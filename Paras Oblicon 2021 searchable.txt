PREFACE TO THE 2021 EDITION
There are numerous new cases decided by the Supreme Court
matter of Obligations and Contracts. While many of these
the
in
decisions merely reiterate existing jurisprudence, there are some,
nonetheless, which illustrate comparatively new concepts. Obviously,
with the dawning of the 21st century, there is much judicial progress
in this highly-important field of law; principally the advent of
electronic contracts vis-a-vis e-Commerce, and the spawning of
derivatives (new exotic financial instruments based on hedging) a
new phenomenon in contracts law.
For the eventual realization of this revised and expanded
edition, the Publisher hereby values the solicitous help rendered
by Dr. Edgardo “Edgie” C. Paras (LL.B., LL.M., and D.C.L.), a
product of the United States (Harvard), Europe (Hague Academy
of International Law), and Asia (National University of Singapore,
Ateneo de Manila, San Beda, and UST Graduate School of Law).

—

Grateful acknowledgments are likewise made to Prof. Emmanuel
C. Paras (Of Counsel of SyCip Salazar Hernandez & Gatmaitan law
firm), RTC Judge of Makati Eugene C. Paras, Yla Paras, a Juris
Doctor of the Ateneo Law School, and MSc in Regulation of the London
School of Economics (LSE), and Edgardo Paras III, a Juris Doctor of
the DLSU College of Law - for additional research.

Chapter 1

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article 1106. By prescription, one acquires ownership
and other real rights through the lapse of time in the manner
and under the conditions laid down by law.
In the same way, rights and actions are lost by
prescription.
COMMENT:
(1) Definition of Prescription

Prescription is a mode of acquiring (or losing) ownership
and other real rights through the lapse of time in the manner
and under the conditions laid down by law, namely, that the
possession should be:

(a)

in the concept of an owner

the claimant must clearly, definitely, and unequivocally
notify the owner of his (the claimant’s) intention to avert
an exclusive ownership in himself. (Clendenin v. Clendenin,

Director of Lands, et al. v. Funtillar, et al.
GR 68533, May 23, 1986

FACTS: Where the land sought to be registered was
declared alienable and disposable 33 years ago, and is no
longer a forest land, and the same has been possessed and
cultivated by the applicants and their predecessors for at

Art. 1106

"

Laches (or “estoppel by laches”) is unreasonable delay in the
bringing of a cause of action before the courts of justice. Thus,
if an action prescribes say in ten years, it should be brought to
court as soon as possible, without waiting for eight or nine years,
unless the delay can be justifiably explained (as when there is
a search for evidence). Note therefore, that while an action has
not yet prescribed, it may no longer be brought to court because
of laches.
As defined by the Supreme Court, “laches is failure or
neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time,
to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should
have been done earlier, it is negligence or omission to assert a
right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that
the party entitled thereto either has abandoned it or declined to
assert it. However, courts will not be bound by strictures of the
statute of limitations or laches when manifest wrong or injuries
would result thereby.” (Cristobal v. Melchor, 78 SCRA 175)
Arradaza, et al. v. Court of Appeals & Larrazabal
GR 50422, Feb. 8, 1989

The principle of laches is a creation of equity. It is applied,
not really to penalize neglect or sleeping upon one’s right, but
rather to avoid recognizing a right when to do so would result

in a clearly inequitable situation.
(6) Rationale for Laches

If a person fails to act as soon as possible in vindication
of an alleged right, it is possible that the right does not really
exist.

Mapa III v. Guanzon

While prescription is concerned with the FACT of delay,
laches deals with the EFFECT of unreasonable delay.
Akang v. Mun. of Isulab,

As a. general rule:
1. An action to recover registered land covered by
System may not be barred by laches; and
Torrens
the
2. neither can laches be set up to resist the
enforcement of an imprescriptible legal right.
[NOTA BENE: Laches is a recourse in “equity” which
is applied only in the absence of statutory law. (Citibank
NA. v. Tanco Gabaldron, 765 SCRA 172; and Phil. Carpet
Manufacturing Corp. v. Tagyaman, 712 SCRA 489)]
[NOTE: Principally a doctrine of equity, laches is applied
to avoid recognizing a right when to do so would result in a
clearly inequitable situation or in an injustice. (Secretary of
Public Works and Highways v. Tecson, 700 SCRA 243)]

David v. Bandin
GR 48322, April 8, 1987

FACTS: A and B, husband and wife, died intestate, leaving
two children, X and Y. X had been administering the property
until her death in Feb. 15, 1955. Plaintiffs, the children of Y,
were given their shares of the fruits of the property, though
irregular and at times little, depending on the amount of the
harvest. On April 23, 1963, plaintiffs, the children of Y, sent a
letter of demand to the heirs ofX for partition, and on June 14,
1963, or within a period of approximately eight years from Xs
death, filed their complaint against Xs heirs.
HELD: Plaintiffs cannot be held guilty of laches, nor is
their claim barred by prescription. Plaintiffs were not guilty of
negligence nor did they sleep on their rights.
4

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1106

Prescription generally does not run in favor of a co-heir
or co-owner as long as he expressly or impliedly recognizes the
co-ownership. While implied or constructive trust prescribes
in ten years, the rule does not apply where a fiduciary relation
exists and the trustee recognizes the trust.

Gallardo v. Intermediate Appellate Court
GR 67742, Oct. 29, 1987
In determining whether a delay in seeking to enforce
a right constitutes laches, the existence of a confidential
relationship between the parties is an important circumstance
for consideration. A delay under such circumstance is not as
strictly regarded as where the parties are strangers to each
other. The doctrine of laches is not strictly applied between near
relatives, and the fact that parties are connected by ties of blood
or marriage tends to excuse an otherwise unreasonable delay.

Narciso Buenaventura & Maria Buenaventura
v. Court of Appeals & Manotok Realty, Inc.
GR 50837, Dec. 28, 1992
The defense of laches applies independently of prescription.
Laches is different from the statute of limitations. Prescription
is concerned with the fact of delay, whereas laches is concerned
with the effect of delay. Prescription is a matter of time; laches
is principally a question of inequity of permitting a claim to
be enforced, this inequity being founded on the same change
in the condition of the property or the relation of the parties.
Prescription is statutory; laches is not. Laches applies in equity,
whereas prescription applies at law. Prescription is based on
fixed time; laches is not.
(8) Constitutional Provision

The right of the State to recover properties unlawfully
acquired by public officials or employees, from them or from their
nominees or transferees, shall not be barred by prescription,
laches, or estoppel. (Sec. 15, Art. XI, The 1987 Philippine
Constitution)

(10) Prescriptive Period on Registered Land Covered by

Torrens System
Quirino Mateo & Matias v.
Dorotea Diaz, et al.
GR 137305, Jan. 17, 2002

FACTS: The land involved is registered under the Torrens
system in the name of petitioners’ father Claro Mateo. There
is no question raised with respect to the validity of the title.
Immediately after petitioners discovered the existence of OCT
206 in 1977 or 1978, they took steps to assert their rights
thereto. They divided the land between the two of them in an
extrajudicial partition. Then petitioners filed the case below to
recover ownership and possession as the only surviving children
of original owners, the late Claro Mateo.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC), Bulacan, at Malolos, ruled
that prescription and laches are applicable against petitioners,
that real actions over an immovable prescribe after 30 years,

Art. 1106

that ownership can be acquired through possession in good faith
and with just title for a period of ten years, and that ownership
may be acquired through uninterrupted adverse possession for
30 years without need of just title or of good faith. The Court of
Appeals (CA) affirmed that of the trial court, thus, this petition
for review on certiorari.
ISSUE: Whether or not the equitable doctrine of laches
may override a provision of the Land Registration Act on
imprescriptibility of title to registered land. Otherwise put, the
issue raised is whether prescription and the equitable principle
of laches are applicable in derogation of the title of the registered

owner.

HELD: A party who had filed immediately a case as soon as
he discovered that the land in question was covered by a transfer
certificate in the name of another person is not guilty of laches.
(St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc. v. Cleo fas, 92 SCRA 389 [1979]) An
action to recover possession of a registered land never prescribe
in view of the provision of Sec. 44 of Act 496 (now Sec. 47 of PD
1529) to the effect that no title to registered land in derogation
to that of a registered owner shall be acquired by prescription
or adverse possession. (J.M. Tuason & Co. v. Aquirre, 7 SCRA
109 [1963])

In fact, there is a host of jurisprudence that hold that
prescription and laches could not apply to registered land covered
by the Torrens system. (Bishop v. CA, 208 SCRA 636 [1992]; and
St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc. v. Cleofas, supra) With more reason
are these principles applicable to laches, which is an equitable
principle. Laches may not prevail against a specific provision
of law, since equity, which has been defined as “justice outside
legality” is applied in the obscene of and not against statutory
law or rules of procedure. (Causapin v. CA, 233 SCRA 615 [1994])
Upon the other hand, the heirs of the registered owner
are not estopped from claiming their father’s property, since
they merely stepped into the shoes of the previous owners.
Prescription is unavailing not only against the registered
owner, but also against his hereditary successors because the
latter merely step into the shoes of the decedent by operation of
law and are merely the continuation of the personality of their

predecessor-in-interest. (Teofila de Guinoo v. CA [97 Phil. 235];
and Gil Atun u. Eusebio Nunez [97 Phil. 762])

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

.

The CA erred in ordering the Register of Deeds to cancel
OCT 206 of Claro Mateo and issue new titles to those who are
occupying the subject land. This violates the indefeasibility of
a Torrens title. The title of Claro Mateo could be cancelled only
if there is competent proof that he had transferred his rights
over the parcel of land to another party, otherwise title would
pass to his heirs only by testate or intestate succession.
The fallo: The Supreme Court thereupon reverses the CA’s
decision. In lieu thereof, the Court remands the case to the trial
court for determination of the heirs of Claro Mateo in a proper
proceeding.

Far East Bank & Trust Co. v. Estrella O. Querimit
GR 148582, Jan. 16, 2002
FACTS: Respondent deposited her savings with petitioner¬
bank. She did not withdraw her deposit even after maturity
date of the certificates of deposit (CDs) precisely because she
wanted to set it aside for her retirement, relying on the bank’s
assurance, as reflected on the face of the instruments themselves,
that interest would “accrue” or accumulate annually even after

their maturity.

Petitioner-bank failed to prove that it had already paid
respondent, bearer and lawful holder of subject CDs, i.e.,
petitioner failed to prove that the CDs had been paid out of its
funds, since evidence by respondent stands unrebutted that
subject CDs until now remain unindorsed, undelivered, and
unwithdrawn by her.
ISSUE: Would it be unjust to allow the doctrine of laches
to defeat the right of respondent to recover her savings which
she deposited with the petitioner?
HELD: Yes, it would be unjust not to allow respondent to
recover her savings which she deposited with petitioner-bank.
For one, Petitioner failed to exercise that degree of diligence
required by the nature of its business. (Art. 1173) Because the
business of banks is impressed with public interest, the degree
of diligence required of banks is more than that of a good father
of the family or of an ordinary business firm.
8

”

Art. 1 106

The fiduciary nature of their relationship with their
depositors requires banks to treat accounts of their clients with
the highest degree of care. (Canlas v. CA, 326 SCRA 415 [2000])
A bank is under obligation to treat accounts of its depositors
with meticulous care whether such accounts consist only of a
few hundred pesos or of millions of pesos. Responsibility arising
from negligence in the performance of every kind of obligation
is demandable. (Prudential Bank v. CA, 328 SCRA 264 [2000])
Petitioner failed to prove payment of the subject CDs issued to
respondent and, therefore, remains liable for the value of the
dollar deposits indicated thereon with accrued interest.
A certificate of deposit is defined as a written acknowledg¬
ment by a bank or banker of the receipt of a sum of money on
deposit which the bank or banker promises to pay to the deposi¬
tor, to the order of the depositor, or to some other person or his
order, whereby the relation of debtor and creditor between the
bank and the depositor is created. Principles governing other
types of bank deposits are applicable to CDs (10 Am Jur 2d
Sec. 455), as are the rules governing promissory notes when
they contain an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain of
money absolutely. (Ibid., Sec. 457)
The principle that payment, in order to discharge a debt,
must be made to someone authorized to receive it is applicable
to the payment of CDs. Thus, a bank will be protected in making
payment to the holder a certificate indorsed by the payee, unless
it has notice of the invalidity of the indorsement or the holder’s
want of title. (10 Am Jur 2d Sec. 461) A bank acts at its peril
when it pays deposits evidenced by a CD, without its production
and surrender after proper indorsement. (Clark v. Young, 21 So.
2d 331 [1994])
The equitable principle of laches is not sufficient to defeat
the rights of respondent over the subject CDs. Laches is the
failure or neglect, for an unreasonable length of time, to do
that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have
been done earlier. It is negligence or omission to assert a right
within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the
party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to
assert it. (Felizardo v. Fernandez, GR 137509, Aug. 15, 2001)
9

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1106

There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes laches or
staleness of demand; each case is to be determined according
to its particular circumstances. The question of laches is
addressed to the sound discretion of the court and, being an
equitable doctrine, its application is controlled by equitable
considerations. It cannot be used to defeat justice or perpetrate
fraud and injustice. Courts will not be guided or bound strictly
by the Statute of Limitations or the doctrine of laches when to
do so manifest wrong or injustice would result. (Rosales v. CA,
GR 137566, Feb. 28, 2001)

Respondent is entitled to moral damages because of the
mental anguish and humiliation she suffered as a result of
the wrongly refusal of petitioner to pay her even after she had
delivered the CDs. (Arts. 2217 and 2219) In addition, petitioner
should pay respondent exemplary damages which the trial court
imposed by way of example or correction for the public good.
(Art. 2229) Finally, respondent is entitled to attorney’s fees since
petitioner’s act or omission compelled her to incur expenses to
protect her interest making such award just and equitable. (Art.
2208)

Development Bank of the Phils, v. Court of Appeals
& Carlos Cqjes
GR 129471, April 28, 2000
FACTS: Petitioner filed an ejectment suit against private
respondent, claiming ownership of a parcel of land covered by
a TCT, which included the 19.4 hectares being occupied by the
latter. The trial court declared petitioner to be the owner of the
land, but the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the trial court.
On appeal, petitioner claimed that its predecessor-in-interest
had become the owner of the land by virtue of the decree of
registration in his name. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA.

HELD: Taking into consideration the possession of
his predecessor-in-interest, private respondent had been in
uninterrupted adverse possession of the land for more than
30 years prior to the decree of registration issued in favor of
petitioner’s predecessor-in-interest. Such possession ripened into
ownership of the land through acquisitive prescription, a mode
of acquiring ownership and other real rights over immovable
property. A decree of registration cut off or extinguished a
10

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1106

right acquired by a person only when such right refers to a
lien or encumbrance on the land which was not annotated on
the certificate of title issued thereon, but not to the right of
ownership thereof. Registration of land does not create a title nor
vest one. Accordingly, the 19.4 hectares of land being occupied
by private respondent must be reconveyed in his favor.
(11) Presumptive Period re: Ill-Gotten Wealth or ‘Behest’

Loans

Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee
on Behest Loans v. Aniano A. Desierto
(Recovery of W-Gotten Wealth)
GR 130340, Oct. 25, 1999
114 SCAD 707

Behest loans, which are part of the ill-gotten wealth
which former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his cronies
accumulated and which the Government through the Presidential
Commission on Good Government (PCGG) seeks to recover, have
a prescriptive period to be counted from the discovery of the
crimes charged, and not from the date of their commission. If
the commission of the crime is known, the prescriptive period
shall commence to run on the day it was committed.
The prosecution of offenses arising from, relating or
incident to, or involving ill-gotten wealth contemplated in Sec.
15, Art. XI of the Philippine Constitution of 1987 may be barred
by prescription. Said provision applies only in civil actions for
recovery of ill-gotten wealth, and not to criminal cases.
(12) Cases

Disini v. Sandiganbayan

705SCRA459

ISSUE: Does the filing of the criminal complaints in the
office of the Ombudsman interrupt the running of the period of
prescription?
HELD: Yes. Irrespective of whether the offense charged
is punishable by the Revised Penal Code on by a special law, it
is the filing of the complaint or information in the office of the
11

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1106

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

public prosecutor for purposes of the preliminary investigation
that interrupts the period of prescription.

Jackwell Parking Systems
Corp. v. Lidua, Sr.
706 SCRA 724

FACTS: Prosecutor facts to seasonably file the information.
ISSUE: Can such circumstance result in the dismissal of
the case against private respondent?

HELD: Yes, unfortunately.
Be it borne in mind that in resolving the matter of
prescription of the offense charge, the following factors should
be considered.
1.
2.

3.

the period of prescription for the offense charged;
the time the period of prescription starts to run; and
the time the prescriptive period was interrupted.

Art. 1106

(15) ‘Defense of Prescription*

The defense of prescription is evidentiary in nature which:
1. could not be established by mere allegations in the
pleadings; and
2. must not be resolved in a motion to dismiss. (Narcise
v. Valbuena, Inc., 831 SCRA 319(2017])
Otherwise stated, as held by the Supreme Court in G.V
Florida Transport, Inc. v. Tiara Commercial Corp., 842 SCRA

576(2017) -

“[p]rescription is a ground for the dismissal of a com¬
plaint without going to trial on the merits.
“[w]hen the issue of prescription requires the deter¬
mination of the evidentiary matters, it cannot be the basis
of an outright dismissal without hearing.”

(16) A *Check’ Is Subject to Prescription of Actions

(13) Query

Evangelista v. Screenex, Inc.
845 SCRA 131

Prescription shall begin to run from the day of the
commission of the violation of the law. But if the same be not
known, at the time, when?

ANS.: From the discovery thereof and the institution
of judicial proceedings for its investigation and punishment.
(Citibank NA. v. Tanco Gabaldon, 705 SCRA 172)
[NOTA BENE: In Panaguiton, Jr. v. Dept, of Justice, 571
SCRA 540 (2008), the Supreme Court expressly ruled that Act
3326 is the law applicable to the offenses under special laws
which do not provide their own prescriptive period.]
(14) Acquisitive Prescription

- A Historical Fact

Cano v. Cano
849 SCRA 176

(2017)

Failure to encash the checks within a reasonable time after
issue, or more than ten years, in this instance, not only results
in the checks becoming stale but also in the obligation to pay
being deemed fulfilled by operation of law.
As the Supreme Court ruled, in the case at bar, a check,
therefore, is subject to prescription of actions upon a written

contract.
(17) Effect Even If Prescription Has Already Set In

Piedad v. Bobilles
846 SCRA 576

(2017)

(2017)

As early as 1902, when Act 496 created the Torrens system
of registration, the law already declared that registered land
cannot be acquired by prescription or adverse possession.

The Supreme Court, in a long line of cases has allowed for
the execution of a final and executory judgment even if prescrip¬
tion has already set in, if the delay was caused by the judgment
obligor for his or her benefit or advantage.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1107

Art. 1107. Persons who are capable of acquiring property
or rights by the other legal modes may acquire the same by
means of prescription.
Minors and other incapacitated persons may acquire
property or rights by prescription, either personally or
through their parents, guardians or legal representatives.

COMMENT:
(1) Who May Acquire Property or Rights by Prescription
(a)

those who can make use of the other modes of acquiring
ownership.

(b)

even minors and other incapacitated persons (like the
insane).

(2) Reason for Par. 1 (Those Capable of Acquiring Property
or Rights Through the Other Modes)

Since prescription is also a mode of acquiring ownership, it
follows that if a person is capable of becoming an owner by the
other legal modes, he should also be capable of acquiring the
same property by prescription. Thus, if a person can become an
owner by donation, he can also become an owner by prescription.
(8) Query (Re Donation by Paramour)

A husband cannot validly receive a donation from a
paramour. Now then, can he acquire by prescription the property
donated to him by the paramour?
ANS.: Yes, but only by extraordinary prescription (not
ordinary prescription) since he would be lacking the element
of “just title.” There would be no “just title” because under the
law, they are incapacitated to donate to each other. (See Art.
739, Civil Code) Note that even if a donation is VOID, it may
constitute the legal basis for adverse possession. (See Tagalgal
v. Luega, CA-GR 19651-R, Feb. 19, 1959)
(4) Reason Why Minors May Acquire Personally

This is because only juridical capacity is required for
possession, not capacity to act. Thus, even discernment of intent

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1108

to possess is not required for such personal acquisition. This is
so because the law makes no distinction.
Art. 1 108. Prescription, both acquisitive and extinctive,
runs against:
(1) Minors and other incapacitated persons who have
parents, guardians or other legal representatives;
(2) Absentees who have administrators, either appoint¬
ed by them before their disappearance, or appointed by the
courts;
(3) Persons living abroad, who have managers or
administrators;
(4) Juridical persons, except the State and its subdivi¬
sions.
Persons who are disqualified from administering their
property have a right to claim damages from their legal
representatives whose negligence has been the cause of

prescription.

COMMENT:
(1) Persons Against Whom Prescription May Run
(a) The Article enumerates four such groups.
(b) Reason for Pars. 1,2, and 3:
These people are supposed to be protected by those
in charge. If they are not properly protected through the
latter’s negligence, a claim for damages against the latter
can prosper.
(2) Query (Re Minors Without Parents, etc.)

Suppose the minors or the insane persons have no parents
or legal representatives, does prescription run against them?
ANS.: While the Article seemingly implies that in such a
case, prescription should not run against them, it is believed that
Secs. 42, 45, and 46 of Act No. 190 (the Code of Civil Procedure)
can apply to them, since implied repeals are not looked upon
with favor. Thus, prescription can still run against minors, the
15

14

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1109

insane, and those in jail, except that these people may still bring
the action within a number of years after their disability has

been removed:
(a) three years
in case of recovery of land
(b) two years
in other civil actions
These saving clauses are in line with some saving clauses
provided for minors and the incapacitated under the New Civil
Code. (See, for example, Art. 285 with respect to the right of a
natural child to compel recognition after the parent’s death, if
the parent dies while the child was still a minor).
If the minor has a guardian, there is NO DOUBT that
prescription runs against him even during minority. (See Wenzel,
et al. v. Surigao Consolidated Mining Co., GR L-10843, May 31,

——

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(b)

Note that there is no prescription even if there has been
a separation of property,” for the same reluctance to sue
each other may still exist.

(c)

Query

ANS.: It is believed that prescription will also not
run, for the law does not distinguish. After all, here, the
separation of property” would be “by judicial decree.”
(d)

—

Exceptions when prescription is specifically provided for
by law, such as:
1)

the prescriptive period for legal separation suits (Art.
120, Civil Code);

2)

alienations made by the husband, without the wife’s
consent. (Art. 173, Civil Code)

(3) State and Its Subdivisions

Art 1109. Prescription does not run between husband and
wife, even though there be a separation of property agreed
upon in the marriage settlements or by judicial decree.
Neither does prescription run between parents and
children, during the minority or insanity of the latter, and
between guardian and ward during the continuance of the
guardianship.

COMMENT:
(1) No Prescription Between Husband and Wife
(a)

—

Reason for the law
The close relationship between
them, engendered by affection or influence, may prevent
one from suing the other. Hence, the general rule is NO

PRESCRIPTION.

[NOTE: The Article was applied in Toriba Fontanilla
Pacio, et al. v. Manuela Pacio Billon, et al., L-15088, Jan.
31, 1961.]

—

Suppose the “separation of property” is the conse¬
quence of legal separation, does prescription run?

1960)

No prescription can run against them, except with reference
to patrimonial property. (See Art. 1113, Civil Code)

Art. 1109

(2) Between Parents and Children
(a)

No prescription shall run between them during the
MINORITY or INSANITY of the latter. A sensu contrario
prescription runs if the legal disability does not exist
anymore.

(b)

As a general rule, even if the child is neither insane nor
incapacitated, an adverse possession cannot be predicated
on the possession of the parent as against the child, or in the
possession of the child as against its parent. Thus, where
a father became insane, and one of his sons managed the
farm during the rest of his father’s lifetime and remained
in possession of it for the statutory period, it was held
that these facts alone did not warrant the presumption
of a conveyance to the son by the father or of a release to
him by the other heirs subsequent to their father’s death.
(1 Am Jur 807, and Director of Lands v. Abiertas, 44 O.G.
923)

(3) Between Guardian and Ward

No prescription runs between them during the continuance
of the guardianship. This is so even if the guardian expressly
17

16

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1110-1111

repudiates the guardianship (without court approval); otherwise,
the trust relationship would be rendered nugatory.

Art. 1110. Prescription, acquisitive and extinctive, runs
in favor of, or against a married woman.

COMMENT:

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1112

Art. 1112. Persons with capacity to alienate property may
renounce prescription already obtained, but not the right to

Prescription is deemed to have been tacitly renounced
when the renunciation results from acts which imply the
abandonment of the right acquired.

Prescription in the Case of a Married Woman

COMMENT:

This Article refers to a married woman and a stranger.

(1) Requisites for Renunciation of Property Acquired by

Prescription

Art. 1111. Prescription obtained by a co-proprietor or a
co-owner shall benefit the others.

(a)

COMMENT:

(b)

The property acquired must have already been obtained
(hence, the right to prescription in the future cannot be
renounced, since manifestly, this would be contrary to
public policy).

(c)

The renouncing must be made by the owner of the right
(not by a mere administrator or guardian, for he does not
own the property).

(d)

The renouncing must not prejudice the rights of others,
such as creditors. (Arts. 6, 1114, Civil Code)

(1) Prescription Obtained by Co-proprietor or Co-owner

Reason:
In a sense, a co-owner or co-proprietor acts for the interest
of the whole co-ownership. Similarly, an action for ejectment
may be brought by just one of the co-owners. (See Art. 487, Civil
Code)

[NOTE, however, that as between or among co-owners,
there can be prescription when there is a definite repudiation of
the co-ownership, made known to the other co-owners. (Laguna
v. Levantino, 71 Phil. 566)1
(2) Limitation

The prescription obtained by a co-owner must have
reference to the property held in common, naturally; otherwise
the Article does not apply.
(3) Where Prescription Cannot Be Appreciated against the

’

(2) Form
(a)

18

may be express or implied (tacit)

(b)

requires no consent on the part of the person to be benefited

(c)

requires no solemnities or formalities

(3) Implied or Tacit Renunciation

There is tacit renunciation when there is an action which
implies the abandonment of the right acquired.
Example:

Co-owners of a Property
This is the case absent any conclusive act of repudiation
made clearly known to the other co-owners. (Heirs of Gilberto
Roldan v. Heirs of Silvela Roldan, 841 SCRA 62 [2017])

Renouncer must have capacity to alienate property
(because renunciation is an exercise to the jus disponendi).

Sonia formerly owed Esperanza but the debt has already
prescribed.
(a)

If Sonia, knowing that the debt has prescribed, nevertheless
still acknowledges the existence of the debt and promises
19

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1113

to pay for it, there is an implied renunciation of the
prescription. She still has a civil obligation.
(b)

If Sonia, knowing that the debt has prescribed, nevertheless
voluntarily pays the debt, she cannot recover what she had
paid. This would be a natural obligation.

(c)

If Sonia, not knowing that the debt has prescribed pays it,
there is no renunciation of the prescription; and she can
still recover on the basis of solutio indebiti.

ILLUSTRATIVE CASE: If a taxpayer, complaining
repeatedly against a tax assessment, makes several requests
for a reinvestigation thereof, he may be said to have WAIVED
the defense of prescription. (Yutivo & Sons Hardware Co. v. Ct.
of Tax Appeals & Collector of Int. Rev., L-13203, Jan. 28, 1961)

Art. 1113. All things which are within the commerce
of men are susceptible of prescription, unless otherwise
provided. Property of the State or any of its subdivisions not
patrimonial in character shall not be the object of prescription.

COMMENT:
(1) Things That May Be Acquired by Prescription

Generally

— all

things within the commerce of man.

(2) Patrimonial Property
(a)

By impheation under this Article, patrimonial property
of the State or any of its subdivisions may be acquired by
prescription.

(b)

While it may be claimed that a direct and clear provision
which says that prescription does
not run against the State or any of its subdivisions) prevails
over an implication (Art. 1113, Civil Code), still when we
consider the intent of Congress in inserting the phrase “not
patrimonial in character” in the original draft submitted by
the Code Commission, it is clear that patrimonial property
may indeed be the subject of prescription. This is so because
patrimonial properties are really in the same category as
private properties.
(Art. 1108, Civil Code

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1113

(3) No Prescription With Respect to Public Property

Public property, however, cannot be the subject of
prescription. This rule applies even to privately owned
unregistered lands which, unless the contrary is shown, are
presumed to be public lands, under the principle that “all lands
belong to the Crown unless they had been granted by the King
(State) or in his name, or by the Kings who preceded him.”
(Valenton v. Murciano, 3 Phil. 53)

However, the rule just stated cannot be altogether
inflexible, as witnessed, for example, by the presence of RA 1942
(approved June 22, 1957), amending Sec. 48(b) of the Public
Land Act (Com. Act 141). Thus, as amended by RA 1952, Sec.
48 of CA 141 now reads as follows:

"Section 48. The following described citizens of the
Philippines occupying lands of the public domain or
claiming to own any such land or an interest therein, but
whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may
apply to the Court of First Instance of the province where
the land is located for confirmation of their claims and the
issuance of a certificate of title therefor, under the Land
Registration Act, to wit:
XXX

“b)
Those who by themselves or through their
predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous,
exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of
agricultural lands of the public domain, under a bona fide
claim of acquisition of ownership, for at least thirty years
immediately preceding the filing of the application for
confirmation of the title except when prevented by war or
force mqjeure. These shall be conclusively presumed to have
performed all the conditions essential to a Government
grant, and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the
provisions of this chapter (the chapter deals with judicial
confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles).”

[NOTE: However, under RA 107, the deadline of the
application was only up to Dec. 31, 1957.]

(c)

A fishpond constructed in the Bambang River can be
ordered removed by the government, regardless of the
number of years that have elapsed since the construction
of said fishpond, inasmuch as a river, or a portion thereof,
is property of public dominion, and cannot therefore
be acquired by acquisitive prescription. (Meneses v.
Commonwealth, 69 Phil. 647)
Similarly, a tract of land, formerly low and swampy, but
gradually raised by the action of the sea, is not susceptible
of prescription, and may therefore be recovered by the
government despite the construction thereon of warehouses
and a wharf. The land is part of the public domain. (Insular
Government v. Aldecoa and Co., 19 Phil. 505)

A plaza intended for public use is likewise not subject to
prescription. (Harty v. Mun. of Victoria, 13 Phil. 152)

Sambrano nevertheless executed a chattel mortgage on his

ISSUE: Can Sambrano later on raise the issue of

prescription?
HELD: No more, for his actuations amount to a renewal
(renovation) of the obligation or to a waiver of the benefit granted
by the law to him. He is, therefore, now estopped from raising the
issue of prescription. Moreover, the Court said that a prescribed
debt may be the subject of novation. (Estrada v. Villaroel, 40

OF THE PHILIPPINES
CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
(1) Specific Provisions on Prescription

(g)

Specific provisions on prescription found elsewhere in
the Code, or in special laws, prevail over the provisions of this
Chapter. This is particularly true in the instances when specific
periods of prescription are provided for.

(a)

A legitimate child may bring an action to claim legitimacy
as long as he is alive (generally). (Art. 173, Family Code)

(b)

An illegitimate child may bring an action to establish
illegitimate filiation during his lifetime (generally). (Art.
175, Family Code)

(c)

The real right of possession of real property is lost at the
end of ten years.

The proceeding for the probate of a will never prescribes.

(Guevara u. Guevara, et al., L-5405, Jan. 31, 1956)

(e)

The proceeding for the deportation of an alien must be
brought within five years from the date the cause for
deportation arose. (Sec. 37, Immigration Act)
[Thus, where an alien entered the Philippines illegally
in 1998, but he violated the Immigration Law in 2004 by
bringing in his wife who was not lawfully entitled to enter
or reside in the Philippines, the deportation proceeding
commenced in 2005 had not prescribed. This is because the
cause accrued in 1999. (See Porta Perez v. Board, L-9236,
May 29, 1957)]

(f)

In order to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Tax Appeals,
the suit for refund of taxes erroneously or illegally assessed
must be brought within the statutory period of two years,
and the requirements provided in the National Internal
Revenue Code must be complied with. (Collector of Internal
Revenue v. Court of Tax Appeals, et al., L-11494, Jan. 28,
1961)

(2) Examples

(d)

Art. 1116

An action to annul a sale of shares of stock in a corporation
is violation of the Securities Act because there was no
permit for the same, and for the recovery of the purchase
price must be instituted within a period of two years from
the date of the sale. Hence, if the sale is made on Oct. 23,
2003, but the action is brought on Nov. 2, 2005, the action
is ten days late, and can no longer be entertained. (See

Benedicto v. Phil. American Finance and Development Co.,
L-8695, May 31, 1957)
24

(h)

An action for accounting or reliquidation of agricultural
crops under par. 3, Sec. 17 of RA 1199 should be brought
within three years from the threshing of the crops in
question. (Agaton Mateo v. Gregorio Duran, et al., L-14314,
Feb. 22, 1961)

Art. 1116. Prescription already running before the
effectivity of this Code shall be governed by laws previously
in force; but if since the time this Code took effect the entire
period herein required for prescription should elapse, the
present Code shall be applicable, even though by the former
laws a longer period might be required.

COMMENT:
(1) Transitional Rules for Prescription
(a) If the period for prescription BEGAN and ENDED under
the OLD laws, said OLD laws govern.
(b)

(c)

If the period for prescription BEGAN under the NEW Civil
Code, the NEW Civil Code governs.
If the period began under the OLD law, and continues
under the NEW Civil Code, the OLD law applies.
Exception:

In this third rule, it is the NEW Civil Code that will
apply, provided two conditions are present:
1) The NEW Civil Code requires a shorter period;
2)

This shorter period has already elapsed since Aug.
30, 1950, the date when the NEW Civil Code became
effective.
25

Art 1116

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(Thus, the period prescribed under the NEW
Code should be counted from Aug. 30, 1950. However,
if by this method a longer period would be needed, a
period that is even longer than that provided under
the OLD law, said OLD law applies.)
(2) Example of the First Rule Given

Paz Ongsiaco and the Heirs of the
Late Augusto Ongsiaco v. Roman D. Dallo, et al.
L-27451, Feb. 28, 1969

FACTS: A complaint was filed in 1966 against the family
of Paz Ongsiaco for recovery of the ownership of a parcel of
land in Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija. It was admitted by claimants
that since 1924 (42 years before the basic complaint was filed in
1966), said family had been in possession of the land and that
said possession was really adverse or in the concept of owner.
However, it was alleged that the possession was in BAD FAITH.
ISSUE: May recovery of the property be allowed?
HELD: Recovery cannot be allowed for the cause of action
has already prescribed. Under Art. 1116, in a case like this, the
law in force before the New Civil Code should apply. It is clear
that under such old law, the Code of Civil Procedure, good or bad
faith was immaterial for purposes of acquisitive prescription.
(Sec. 41) Moreover, even the 30-year period fixed in the New
Civil Code for the acquisition in bad faith by prescription of real
property had already expired when this case was filed in 1966.
(3) Example of the Third Rule Given

BAR
A, with knowledge that B is not the owner of a parcel of
land, buys it for a nominal sum from B in 1944, and since then
has been in open, actual, continuous, and public possession
thereof, under claim of title exclusive of any other rights and
adverse to all other claimants. C, the real owner of the land,
who has left in 1944 by reason of the war, was able to return to
the land only in 1958 and learning of A’s possession, files suit.
A claims prescription of ten years, because he took possession
26

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1116

of the land before the new Civil Code; but C counters that as
A entered the land in bad faith, and he had not yet acquired
ownership by the time the New Civil Code took effect, the period
is 30 years under the New Code. Decide with reasons.

ANS.: Inasmuch as here the prescription was already
running before Aug. 30, 1950, it follows that only ten years
would be required because under the Code of Civil Procedure,
regardless of good faith or bad faith, the period for acquiring
land by prescription was only ten years. (Sec. 41, Act 190, Code
of Civil Procedure; and Osorio v. Tan Jongko, 51 O.G. 6221)
It, therefore, follows necessarily that in 1954, A had already
acquired the property by acquisitive prescription. Hence, C
should lose the case, unless of course the land is covered by a
Torrens Certificate of Title. (Osorio v. Tan Jongko, supra)

The period of ten years must necessarily start from 1944,
and not from Aug. 30, 1950, since here, the prescriptive period
under the OLD law was SHORTER. Had the period under the
old law been LONGER, it is the shorter period under the new
Civil Code that should apply, but this time, the period should
commence from the date of effectivity of the new Civil Code
Aug. 30, 1950 in view of the clause “but if since the time this
Code took effect . ."

(4) Example of the Exception

Under the old law, the period was ten years (as in the
case of reduction of a donation of land on the ground of birth of
a child), but under the New Civil Code, the period is only four
years, counted from the birth of the first child. (Art. 763) It is
clear here that the New Civil Code (four years) will apply, even
if the donation and the birth occurred under the old law, but
the period should be counted from Aug. 30, 1950, unless in so
doing, a period of more than ten years would result.
(5) Some Doctrines
(a)

In Estayo v. De Guzman, L-10902, Dec. 29, 1958, the
Supreme Court held that when the action to enforce the
mortgage presented as an appeal bond in a court action
became effective by the entry of the judgment of the
27

Ait. 1116

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Supreme Court on Aug. 6, 1940, the encumbrance may be
cancelled after Aug. 6, 1950.
(b)

In Ongsiako, et al. v. Ongsiako, et al., L-7510, March
30, 1957, the Supreme Court held that Art. 1116 (Civil
Code) prevails over the general transitory rule in Art.
2258 (Civil Code) which provides that actions and rights
which came into being but which were not exercised
before the effectivity of the Code, shall remain in full force
in conformity with the old legislation, but the exercise,
duration, and procedure to enforce them shall be regulated
by the Rules of Court.

(c)

In Borromeo v. Zaballero, L-14357, Aug. 31, 1960, a
promissory note was executed in 1935, payable in 1937.
The claim for payment was presented in the settlement of
the estate of the deceased debtor in Sept. 1955. The Court
ruled that the ten-year period of prescription under Act
190 had already lapsed.

ten years), despite written extrajudicial demand in 1954
for the satisfaction of the judgment. This is because this
case is governed not by Art. 1155 of the Civil Code, but by
Sec. 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure (which section does
not state that such written extrajudicial demands interrupt
the prescriptive period). The old law applies because
Art. 1116 says “prescription already running before the
effectivity of this Code shall be governed by laws previously
in force . .

(d)

In Nagrampa, et al. v. Nagrampa, L-15434, Oct. 31, 1960,
the Court observed that under the old law, no special period
of prescription was fixed for the revocation of donations for
non-compliance with the conditions stipulated. However,
under the New Civil Code (Art. 764), the period fixed for
such a case is four years. The suit was filed in July, 1958,
alleging that the plaintiffs had demanded compliance “five
years ago, but the defendant refused.” The Court held that
the entire period of four years fixed by the New Civil Code
has elapsed since it took effect in 1950. Suit was filed only
in July 1958 for a violation made in 1953.
(e) In Amar v. Odianan, L-15179, Sept. 30, 1960, a complaint
for the recovery of land was filed in November 1948,
alleging that in April 1948, the land had been seized by the
defendant by means of fraud, deceit, and strategy. It was
held that the old law, Sec. 40 of Act 190 (which provided
that an action for the recovery of real property can only
be brought within ten years) was applicable, and that
therefore, the action has already prescribed.
(f) InPNB v. Galicano Ador Dionisio, L-18342, Sept.
19, 1963,
it was held that a judgment that had become final in 1949
could not be revived anymore in 1960 (lapse of more than

(2) Possessor in the Concept of Holder

A possessor in the concept of holder cannot acquire property
by prescription because his possession is not adverse. Thus, the
possession of land in the capacity of administrator (mere holder)
cannot ripen into ownership. (Ranjo v. Payoma, L-1866, May 30,
1951) Neither is the possession by a mortgagee adverse. ( Garcia
v. Arjona, L-7279, Oct. 29, 1955)

The mere fact that the person who claims ownership of the
property also administers the same does not militate against
its acquisition of the property by prescription. The fact that he
stated that he administered the properties in question does not

COMMENT:
(1) Prescription of Titles Recorded in Registry of Property

It is clear that Art. 1126 does NOT refer to land registered
under the Land Registration Law (with a Torrens Title).
(b) It, however, refers to all other lands.
(a)

(c)

(2) Lands Registered under the Land Registration Law

Lands registered under the Torrens system cannot be
acquired by prescription (Alfonso v. Jayme, L-12754, Jan. 30,
1960) but this rule can be invoked only by one under whose name
(or under whose predecessor’s name) it was registered. (Jocson,
et al. v. Silos, L-12998, July 25, 1960)

Example:

Arcadio is the owner of land not protected by a Torrens
Title. His right is, however, duly registered in the Registry
(for the deed of sale in his favor has been duly registered).
1)

If Artemio, a stranger, takes possession of the land
in good faith (from a seller-forger), is there a chance
for him to become, after ten years, the owner of the
land, as against Arcadio?

ANS.: Yes, after all, Arcadio is not protected by
a Torrens Title. He certainly is not the third person
referred to in the Article. (See Sison v. Ramos, 13 Phil.
54) Thus, as between Arcadio and Artemio, Artemio
becomes the owner at the end of ten years.
2)

Suppose 12 years after Artemio takes possession,
Arcadio sells the land to Benedicto, an innocent
purchaser for value (who, in investigating Arcadio’s
title found that the property was indeed registered in
Arcadio’s name), will Benedicto become the owner?

ANS.: Yes, for insofar as the innocent world was
concerned, Arcadio was still the owner at the time he
sold it to Benedicto. He could therefore validly transfer
ownership to Benedicto Artemio’s prescriptive right
should clearly not prejudice Benedicto.
[NOTE: If Artemio had caused his title to be
registered, he could have become the owner insofar as
the entire world was concerned, not from the time he
registered the forged deed of sale in his favor but from
the time of the lapse of ten years after such recording.
What begins to run from such recording is not the
ownership, but the period or time for prescription.]

Alfonso v. Jayme
L-12754, Jan. 30, 1960
FACTS: Plaintiffs land, protected by a Torrens Title, was
taken by Pasay City for conversion into a road in 1925, without
compensation. In 1954, plaintiff sued for recovery of the land or
its value.

HELD: Since the land was under his name under the
Torrens system, plaintiff remained owner, and could recover
possession at any time. However, because it is now a ROAD,
it is not convenient to restore it to plaintiff. Pasay City was
ordered to pay compensation based on the value of the land in
1925, with legal interest as damages.
Jocson, et al. v. Silos
L-12998, July 25, 1960

FACTS: A widower sold conjugal property, registered under
his name under the Torrens system, to an innocent purchaser
for value, who was subsequently given or issued a new transfer
certificate of title, under his (the buyer’s) name. 22 years later,
the heirs of the deceased spouse (the wife) sued for annulment
of the sale with respect to one-half of the land.
HELD: The suit for annulment and recovery has already
prescribed. The claim of imprescriptibility would have been
correct if the land had been registered in the name of the
husband and wife, not in the name of the husband alone.
Art. 1127. The good faith of the possessor consists in the
reasonable belief that the person from whom he received
the thing was the owner thereof, and could transmit his
ownership.

(1) Other Requisites for Good Faith

The requisites in the Articles mentioned must ALL be
present otherwise, there is no good faith.
(a) Art. 526. He is deemed a possessor in good faith who is not
aware that there exists in his title or mode of acquisition
any flaw which invalidates it.

(b)

—

He is deemed a possessor in bad faith who possesses in any
case contrary to the foregoing.
Mistake upon a doubtful or difficult question of law may
be the basis of good faith.
(b)

For real property, three years of possession in bad faith
would be equivalent to one year of possession in good faith.
(Reason: 30 years would be required for extraordinary
prescription, but only ten years are needed for ordinary

Art. 527. Good faith is always presumed, and upon him
who alleges bad faith on the part of a possessor rests the
burden of proof.

Art. 528. Possession acquired in good faith does not lose
this character except in the case and from the moment
facts exist which show that the possessor is not unaware
that he possesses the thing improperly or wrongfully.
(d) Art. 529. It is presumed that possession continues to be
enjoyed in the same character in which it was acquired,
until the contrary is proved.
(c)

(2) For How Long the Good Faith Must Last

The good faith must last throughout the required period.
(TS, Jan. 25, 1945)
38

For personal property, two years of possession in bad faith
would be equivalent to one year in good faith.
(Reason: Extraordinary prescription needs eight
years; ordinary prescription, four years).

Art. 1129. For the purposes of prescription, there is just
title when the adverse claimant came into possession of the
property through one of the modes recognized by law for the
acquisition of ownership or other real rights, but the grantor
was not the owner or could not transmit any right.

COMMENT:
Nature of the Title Required
(a)

1

What is really meant by just title is “titulo Colorado,’ that
is, there was a mode of acquisition but the grantor was
not the owner. Had he been the owner, there would be no
more necessity for prescription. (See Doliendo v. Biarnesa,
7 Phil. 232; see also Genova u. Cariobaldes, CA-GR 15945R, March 25, 1957, 53 O.G. 4511)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1131-1132

(b)

“True and valid” as used in Art. 1130 does not mean one
without any defect, for in such a case, there would be
no necessity for prescription. What it means is that the
mode should ordinarily have been valid and true, had the
grantor been the owner. (Doliendo v. Biarnesa, 7 Phil.
232; 2 Castan 240) Thus, if aside from the defect of the
grantor not being the owner, there is another defect that
would render the acquisition void, the title thus acquired
would not be sufficient for ordinary prescription. Such for
example would be the case if the contract were absolutely
simulated; or when a husband, pretending to be the owner
of certain property, would donate it to his paramour. Even if
the husband had been the owner, the donation would have
been null and void just the same. Here, the donee, lacking
“just title,” can acquire ownership by extraordinary, not by
ordinary prescription.

be proved; it is never presumed.

The possession of movable property acquired in good faith is
equivalent to a title. Nevertheless, one who has lost any movable
or has been unlawfully deprived thereof, may recover it from
the person in possession of the same.

If the possessor of a movable lost or of which the owner has

the price paid therefor. (Art. 559, Civil Code)

Necessity of Proving the Just Title
(a)

Proof is needed in view of the aggressive or offensive
character of prescription.

(b)

In prescription, therefore, the presumption of just title
given under Art. 541 regarding DEFENSE of rights does
not apply. (See 2 Castan 241)

Art. 1 132. The ownership of movables prescribes through
uninterrupted possession for four years in good faith.
The ownership of personal property also prescribes
through uninterrupted possession for eight years, without
need of any other condition.

With regard to the right of the owner to recover personal
property lost or of which he has been illegally deprived, as
well as with respect to movables acquired in a public sale,
fair, or market, or from a merchant’s store the provisions of
Articles 559 and 1505 of this Code shall be observed.

Merchant’s Store
Subject to the provisions of this Title, where goods are
sold by a person who is not the owner thereof, and who does not
sell them under authority or with the consent of the owner, the
buyer acquired no better title to the goods than the seller had,
unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded from
denying the seller’s authority to sell.
Nothing in this Title, however, shall affect:
(a)

The provisions of any factors’ acts, recording laws, or any
other provision of law enabling the apparent owner of goods
to dispose of them as if he were the true owner thereof;

(b)

The validity of any contracts of sale under statutory
power of sale or under the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction;

Regarding immovables, possession by force or violence does

(a)

The Article does not apply when the civil courts are open. In
Rio y Campania u. Datu Jolkipli, L-12301, April 13, 1959,
the Supreme Court held that the statute of limitations is
suspended if during wartime, courts are not or cannot be
kept open. However, to invoke this rule, a party must first
show that the court was closed or could not be opened for
business as a consequence of chaos and confusion. The
determination of this matter is a question of fact, which
should be ventilated in the hearing of a case on the merits.

(3) What Are Not Needed

Under this Article, neither good faith nor just title is
essential; hence, property voidly donated may be acquired by
extraordinary prescription. This may for instance occur when the
donation of real properties had not been validly accepted by the
donee. Although here the donation is void, it may be the basis for
the acquisition of the donee of said properties by prescription.
(Guarin, et al. v. De Vera, L-9577, Feb. 28, 1957; and Pensader
v. Pensader, 47 Phil. 959)
(4) Retroactive Effect of the Prescription

Prescription has a retroactive effect, that is, the acquirer,
as soon as the necessary period has lapsed, is considered
the owner from the BEGINNING of the possession. Thus,
any encumbrances made by him during said period should

be considered as valid, while those of the original owner are
not binding on the acquirer by prescription. The acquirer is
also entitled to all the fruits during said period in view of his
retroactive ownership. (2 Castan 254-255)

Art. 1138

COMMENT:
Rules for Computation of Time
Par. 1 Tacking of Possession
(a)

—

This means ADDING the period of possession of the
predecessor. Reason: The true owner of the property was
after all NOT in possession, during the possession of said
predecessor.

(b)

Tacking is allowed only if there be privity of relationship
between the predecessor and the successor, as in the case
of succession, donation, sale, barter, etc. Thus, a mere
intruder or usurper cannot “tack.” (See Razote v. Razote,
14 Phil. 182; Lacson v. Gov’t., 39 Phil. 63)
(c) “Tacking” by a subsequent possessor of his predecessor’s
possession can be allowed if the predecessor’s possession
can satisfy the requisites for prescription (such as the
fact that the possession must be in the concept of owner,
peaceful, etc.). (See 2 Corpus Juris 92; and Casilag v.
Fajardo, CA-GR 1066-R, June 18, 1948, 46 O.G. 570)
Par. 2 Presumption of Continuing Possession

—

The presumption is expressly declared to be rebuttable.

Art. 1138. In the computation of time necessary for
prescription, the following rules shall be observed:
(1) The present possessor may complete the period
necessary for prescription by tacking his possession to that
of his grantor or predecessor in interest;
(2) It is presumed that the present possessor who was

(4) Effect of Death on Prescription

Chapter 3

PRESCRIPTION OF ACTION
Art. 1139. Actions prescribe by the mere lapse of time
fixed by law.

COMMENT:
(1) How Actions Prescribe

By the mere lapse of the time indicated in the law. There
is no other requirement.
(2) Scope or Nature of the Chapter

This chapter is our general Statute of Limitations, because
particular provisions on prescription naturally prevail. (See Art.
1148, Civil Code)
(3) Prescription as a Defense

In general, we may say that the prescription of action is
available as a DEFENSE. To be asserted as such, it must be
specifically pleaded and proved. (Hodges v. Salas, 63 Phil. 567)
Thus, if not set up or pleaded as a defense, proof cannot later
on be presented if objection is made to the introduction of such
proof. (National Bank v. Escudero, 92 Phil. 150) Upon the other
hand, as long as the defendant raised the defense of prescription
in his answer to the complaint, but the complaint was dismissed
on some other ground, he can still set up in his brief in the
appellate court in an appeal by the plaintiff from the decision of
the trial court. (Lapuz v. Sy Uy, L-10079, May 17, 1957) If the
issue of prescription can be decided from the averments of the
pleadings, more particularly from the plaintiffs complaint, there
is NO necessity of receiving evidence on the matter, before the
Court may dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription.
(Bamboo, et al. v. Lednicky, et al., L-15495, Jan. 28, 1961)
46

If a father has a cause of action against a stranger (the
period of prescription of which is, let us say, four years) and the
father dies before the end of such prescriptive period, should
prescription continue to run, even if say his children are still
MINORS? The Supreme Court in the case of Martir, et al. v.
Trinidad, et al., L-12057, May 20, 1959, answered YES, for
after all in this case the cause of action accrued in favor of the
father himself, and not directly in favor of the children. Except
where a statute provides otherwise, one disability (like the
father’s death) CANNOT be tacked to another’s disability (like
the children’s minority). Nor can a party avail himself of several
disabilities, unless they all existed at the time when the right
of action accrued. This is in obedience to the universal rule that
when a Statute begins to run, no subsequent disability can stop
its operation unless specially so provided in the statute.
(5) Conflict of Laws

Re Prescription

— Variance of Foreign and Local Law

In the case of D"Almeida v. Hagedorn, L-10804, May 22,
1957, an action was brought in 1954 in the Philippines on two
demand notes executed in 1942 and 1943 in Hong Kong where
both debtor and creditor were residing until liberation. The
Court, in applying the rule that the moratorium law suspended
the running of the prescriptive period and that therefore the
action had not prescribed, ruled that prescription is governed by
the law of the forum. It would seem from this ruling that even
if the cause of action accrued in Hong Kong and has already
prescribed under Hong Kong law, it has not yet prescribed under
Philippine law. This seems to lose sight of a section of Act 190
(Code of Civil Procedure) which states that “if, by the laws of the
State or country where the cause of action arose, the action is
barred, it is also barred in the Philippines.” In the instant case,
however, there was no proof that the claim was barred under
Hong Kong law, and it is well-settled that in the absence of proof
of the foreign law, it is presumed to be the same as Philippine
law.
[NOTE: The presumption has been referred to as a
“processual presumption.”]

(6) How Long Is a Month?

Quizon v. Baltazar
76 SCRA 560
The term "month" as used in a law (such as Art. 90 of the
Revised Penal Code) is understood to refer to a 30-day month
and not to a calendar month.
(7) Query

Does a property deemed part of the public forest prescribe?
ANS.: An action for reversion filed by the State to recover
property registered in favor of any party which is part of the
public forest or of a forest reservation never prescribes. (Heirs
of the Late Spouses Pedro S. Palanca and Soteranea Rafols Vda.
de Palanca v. Republic, 500 SCRA 209 [2006])

Art. 1140. Actions to recover movables shall prescribe
eight years from the time the possession thereof is lost, unless
the possessor has acquired the ownership by prescription for
a less period, according of Article 1 132, and without prejudice
to the provisions of Articles 559, 1505, and 1 133.

COMMENT:
Recovery of Movables

This refers to extraordinary prescription for movables.

Art. 1141. Real action over immovables prescribe after

Art. 1142

De Jesus, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 57092, Jan. 21, 1993
Prescription running even after the effectivity of the New
Civil Code on August 30, 1950, continued to be governed by Sec.
41 of the Old Civil Code.
Under the present Civil Code, the prescriptive period
required for the acquisition of immovable property is ten years
if the possession is in good faith, and 30 years if in bad faith.
Such open, continuous, exclusive and notorious occupation of the
disputed property for 30 years must be conclusively established.
Reckoned from the time she executed the affidavit of
adjudication in 1961, eleven years after the New Civil Code had
taken effect, private respondent’s possession of the contested lot
is far too short of the prescriptive period of 30 years, considering
that her possession is in bad faith. The filing of the petition for
recovery of ownership and possession and quieting of title by
petitioners on April 27, 1973 was well below the acquisitive
prescriptive period for private respondent, which is 30 years
under Art. 1141 of the present Civil Code. In this case, the
statutory period of prescription is deemed to have commenced
when petitioners were made aware of a claim adverse to them,
i.e., when the affidavit of adjudication was duly registered with
the Registry of Deeds which, at the earliest may be considered
to be in 1974, when private respondent was able to secure a tax
declaration in her name.

Art. 1142. A mortgage action prescribes after ten years.

thirty years.

This provision is without prejudice to what is established
for the acquisition of ownership and other real rights by
prescription.

(b)

The possession de jure of an immovable is lost, however,
at the end of ten years. (No. 4, Art. 555, Civil Code)
48

Ten years.

From what moment must the ten-year period be counted?
From the day on which it could have been brought. (Art. 1150,
Civil Code) Thus, if the parents of an employee should execute
a real estate mortgage to secure a performance bond given by a
surety company for their son, the period of prescription begins
49

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1143

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

from the moment the surety company pays by reason of said
bond because from said date, the mortgagors become liable,
and foreclosure can be made. (Nabong v. Luzon Surety Co., Inc.,
L-10034, May 17, 1957)

(2) Some Other Actions That Do Not
(a)

(3) Lands with a Torrens Title

While lands with a Torrens Title cannot be acquired by
prescription (Sec. 39, Act 496; and Rosario v. Aud. General,
L-11817, April 30, 1958), still the right to foreclose a mortgage
on such lands does prescribe for what does not prescribe is the
ownership of said lands.
(4) Effect If Mortgage Is Registered

Even if a mortgage is registered, the action to foreclose
upon it may still prescribe. (Buhat v. Besana, 50 O.G. 4215,
Sept. 1954)
(5) Effect on Interest on Debt

If a mortgage debt had already prescribed, so also has the
action to recover interest thereon. ( Soriano v. Enriquez, 24 Phil.
584)

Art. 1143. The following rights among others specified
elsewhere in this Code, are not extinguished by prescription:

The right to demand partition does not prescribe. (See
Art. 494 of the Civil Code)
(b)

The action (or the defense) for the declaration of contract
of marriage as null and void or inexistent. (See
Art. 1410;

(d) The action for the quieting of title so long as the plaintiff
is in possession of the property. (Sapto, et al. v. Fabiana,

COMMENT:

Art. 1143

Generally, an action to recover property expressly placed
in trust (express trust) cannot prescribe in view of
the confidence reposed, UNLESS such trust has been
repudiated unequivocally. However, constructive trusts
are affected by prescription and laches in view of the lack
of confidence or fiduciary relations. (Diaz, et al. u. Garricho
and Agriado, L-l 1229, March 20, 1958; see Bachrach Motor
Co. v. Lejano, L-10910, Jan. 16, 1959; see also comments

under Art. 1456, this Volume)
(g)

An action to compel reconveyance of property with a
Torrens Title does NOT prescribe if the registered owner
had obtained registration in bad faith, and the property
is still in the latter’s name. The reason is that the
registration is in the nature of a continuing and subsisting

trust. (Caladiao v. Vda. de Blas, L-19063, April 29, 1964)
However, if the property has already passed to an innocent
purchaser for value, the principle of imprescriptibility
does not apply. (Ibid.) [NOTE: In Gerona, et al. v. Carmen
de Guzman, et al., L- 19060, May 29, 1964, however, the
Supreme Court stated that although there are some
decisions to the contrary, it is already settled that an action
for reconveyance of real property based upon a constructive
or implied trust, resulting from fraud, may be barred by
prescription. The period is four years from the discovery
of the fraud.]

(j)

An action brought by a buyer of land to compel the seller to
execute the proper deed of conveyance does NOT prescribe,
provided that said buyer is still in POSSESSION. (See

Villamor v. Court of Appeals
GR 97332, Oct. 10, 1991
Under Art. 1144(1) of the Civil Code, actions upon a written

contract must be brought within ten years. The deed of option
was executed on Nov. 11, 1971. The acceptance was also made

in the same instrument. The complaint was filed by Villamor
on July 13, 1987, 17 years from the time of the execution of the
contract. Hence, the right of action had prescribed. There were
allegations by Villamor that they demanded from Reyes as early
as 1984 the enforcement of their rights under the contract. Still,
it was beyond the ten-year period prescribed by the Civil Code.
It is of judicial notice that the price of real estate in Metro
Manila is continuously on the rise. To allow Villamor to demand
the delivery of the property subject of this case 13 years or 17
53

1
CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1144

years after the execution of the deed at the price of only P70
per square meter is iniquitous. For reasons of equity and in
consideration of the fact that Reyes has no other decent place
to live in, the Court in the exercise of equity jurisdiction, is not
inclined to grant Villamor’s prayer.
(2) Example of a Written Contract

A passenger of a ship, or his heirs, can bring an action based
on culpa contractual within a period of ten years because the
TICKET issued for the transportation is by itself a COMPLETE
WRITTEN CONTRACT. (Peralta de Guerrero, et al. v. Madrigal
Shipping Co., L-12951, Nov. 17, 1959)
[NOTE: An action for the reformation of a written contract
prescribes in ten years. (Jayme v. Judge Nestor Alampay,
L-39592, Jan. 28, 1975)]
[NOTE: In this case, the Court held that “although the
complaint does not state that the transportation was undertaken
by virtue of a written contract of carriage, nevertheless this
can be implied from the complaint because it is a matter of
common knowledge that whenever a passenger boards a ship for
transportation from one place to another, he is issued a ticket
wherein the terms of the contract are specified.”]
(3) Examples of Obligations Created by Law
(a) The obligation to pay indemnity for a legal right of way.
(If the right of way of a public road was acquired in 1914,
the claim for payment of the same brought to the AuditorGeneral only in 1955 has prescribed, especially where, due
to the loss of the papers during the war, the Government
cannot be sure that no payment has been made). (Rosario

v. Auditor-General, L-11817, April 30, 1958)
(b) An action to recover compensation for the death of a worker
or employee, being an action based on law, prescribes in
ten years, in the absence of any specific provision of law
on the matter. (Under the former law, Act 190, said action
prescribed after six years). (Pan Phil. Corp. v. Workmen’s
Compensation Com. and Frias, L-9807, April 17, 1957)
[NOTE: In the Pan Phil. Corporation case, the death
occurred on Dec. 25, 1945. The claim was filed with the

Workmen’s Compensation Division of the Bureau of Labor
on Feb. 11, 1949. The Bureau then ordered the employer to
pay compensation on Sept. 9, 1950, but on June 20, 1952,
the Workmen’s Compensation Commission was created and
it took cognizance of the case. On Feb. 3, 1955, decision was
rendered on the claim which was subsequently affirmed
by the Commissioner, but the employer raised the defense
of prescription, on the ground that when the Commission
assumed jurisdiction over the case on June 20, 1952, the
six years’ prescription period provided for in Act 190 had
already expired. The Supreme Court affirmed the ruling
of the Commission that the period of prescription had been
extended by Art. 1144(2) of the Civil Code to ten years from
the accrual of the action and that the ten-year period did
not expire until Dec. 25, 1965. On the claim that Art. 1144
could not be applied because Art. 2252 of the Code provides
that changes made and new provisions and rules laid
down by this Code which may prejudice or impair vested
or acquired rights in accordance with the old legislation
shall have “no retroactive effect” and that the application
of Art. 1144 would impair vested rights of the employer,
the Court held that the employer had no vested right when
the period of six years provided in Act 190 did not expire
until Dec. 15, 1951.]
(4) Actions Based on a Judgment

The judgment referred to here must be a final and executory
one (that is, on appeal, the judgment was confirmed, or that no
appeal was ever made within the proper period). Parenthetically,
the validity of a judgment or order of a court which has become
final and executory, may be attacked generally only by a direct
action, or proceeding to annul the same. (See Rosensons, Inc.,
et al. v. Hon. Jose Jimenez, et al., L-41225, Nov. 11, 1975)

Installments for support granted by a final judgment
prescribe after ten years, each particular installment prescribing
after ten years from the time it is due. (Trinidad Florendo v.
Rufino Organo, L-4037, Nov. 29, 1951)
[NOTE: Under the Rules of Court, a judgment becomes
DORMANT after five years. This means that the judgment
55

54

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1144

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

may be enforced only within five years by writ of execution.
Thereafter, since the judgment has become dormant, it can be
enforced only by another action, within ten years from the time
there was final judgment on the first action. (See Sec. 6, Rule
39, Revised Rules of Court) It necessarily follows that the action
to enforce the judgment must be filed within ten years. The
time, however, that a moratorium law affecting the obligation
was in force should be deducted from the ten-year prescriptive
period for the reason that moratorium laws have the effect of
tolling (suspending) the prescriptive period. (PNB v. Aboitiz and
Pascual, L-9500, April 11, 1957; Tioseco v. Day, L-9944, April
30, 1957; Liboro, et al. v. Finance and Mining Investment Corp.,
L-8948, Nov. 29, 1957; Intestate Estate of Montilla, Jr. v. Pacific
Co., L-8223, Dec. 20, 1955; and Manila Motor Co., Inc. v. Flores,
L-9396, Aug. 16, 1956)]

In Quimabao v. Mora, L-12690, May 25, 1960, a driver
was convicted in a criminal case on May 19, 1950, and was
sentenced among other things, to indemnify the offended party
in the amount of P2.000. However, said driver was insolvent.
ISSUE: What is the prescriptive period for suing the
driver’s employer for his subsidiary liability?
HELD: Ten years, for the suit is based, not on the driver’s
negligence, but on the final judgment in the criminal case.

In Heirs of Sindiong v. Committee, L-15975, April 30, 1964,
it was held that an action to enforce a decision (or to revive a
court judgment) prescribes upon the expiration of ten years from
the date the decision became final.
Olego v. Rebueno
L-39350, Oct. 29, 1975

FACTS: More than ten years after a judicial compromise
had been approved, plaintiff sought to cite defendant in contempt
of court for having allegedly violated the judgment.
ISSUE: May this be done?

HELD: No, this will not be allowed, for in effect what
plaintiff wanted was to enforce a judgment that had prescribed
(ten years had passed) through the institution of contempt
proceedings.

Art. 1144

(5) Action Not Actually Based on Written Contract

Bucton, et al. v. Gabar, et al.
L-36359, Jan. 31, 1974
FACTS: Villarin sold in 1946 to Gabar a parcel of land on
the installment plan. Gabar in turn had an oral agreement with
Bucton that the latter would pay half of the price, and thus own
half of the land. Bucton paid her share to Gabar, and was given

in 1946 receipts acknowledging the payment.

In 1947, Villarin executed a formal deed of sale in favor
of Gabar, who immediately built a house on half of the lot.
Bucton took possession of the other half, and built improvements
thereon. When Bucton asked for a separate title, she was refused,
and so, in 1968, she filed a complaint to compel Gabar to execute
a formal deed of sale in her favor. The Court of Appeals ruled that
the action had already prescribed because this was an action to
enforce a written contract, and should have been brought within
ten years from 1946, under Art. 1144 of the Civil Code.
ISSUE: Has the action really prescribed?

HELD: No, the action has not really prescribed. The error
of the Court of Appeals is that it considered the execution of the
receipt (in 1946) as the basis of the action. The real basis of the
action is Bucton’s ownership (and possession of the property).
No enforcement of the contract of sale is needed, because the
property has already been delivered to Bucton, and ownership
thereof has already been transferred by operation of law under
Art. 1434, referring to property sold by a person (Gabar) who
subsequently becomes the owner thereof. The action here
therefore is one to quiet title, and as Bucton is in possession,
the action is imprescriptible.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1144

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

docketed as Civil Case L-787, a complaint for recovery of sum
of money against petitioner alleging that: (1) their father was
insured by petitioner under Life Insurance Policy 1305486
with a face value of P50.000; (2) their father died of “coronary
thrombosis” on Nov. 25, 1980; (3) on June 22, 1981, they claimed
and continuously claimed all the proceeds and interests under
the life insurance policy in the amount of P641.000; and (4)
despite repeated demands for payment and/or settlement of the

claim due from petitioner, the last of which was on Dec. 1, 1994,
petitioner finally refused or disallowed said claim on Feb. 14,
1995. In view thereof, private respondents filed their complaint
on June 20, 1995.

.

Petitioner filed an Answer with Counterclaim and Motion
to Dismiss, contending that:
1.

2.

3.

private respondents sent a letter dated May 25, 1983
requesting for reconsideration of the denial; and

4.

in a letter dated July 11, 1983, it reiterated its decision to
deny the claim for payment of the proceeds more than ten
years later, or on Dec. 1, 1994, it received a letter from Jose
C. Claro, a provincial board member of Camarines Sur,
reiterating the early request for reconsideration which it
denied in a letter dated Feb. 14, 1995.

Private respondents opposed the motion to dismiss. On
June 7, 1996, the RTC issued an Order which reads, in part:
“After a perusal of the motion to dismiss by defendants’ counsel
and the objection submitted by plaintiff’s counsel, the court
finds that the matters treated in their respective pleadings
are evidentiary in nature, hence, the necessity of a trial on the

merits.” Petitioner’s motions for reconsideration was denied by
the RTC in its Order dated Dec. 12, 1997 upholding, however,
in the same Order the claim of private respondents’ counsel that
the running of the ten-year period was “stopped” on May 25, 1983
when private respondents requested for a reconsideration of the
denial, and it was only on Feb. 14, 1995 when petitioner finally
decided to deny their claim that the ten-year period began to run.
Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of Appeals
(CA). On April 30, 1999, the CA rendered its decision finding no
grave abuse of discretion committed by the court a quo when it
issued the Orders dated June 7, 1996 and dated Dec. 12, 1997,
respectively. Hence, the present petition for review.

ISSUE: Whether or not the complaint filed by private
respondents for payment of life insurance is already barred by
prescription of action.

the cause of action of private respondents had prescribed
and they are guilty of laches;
it had denied private respondents’ claim in a letter dated
March 12, 1982 on the ground of concealment on the part
of the decreased insured Faustino when he asserted in his
application for insurance coverage that he had not been
treated for indication of “chest pain, palpitation, high blood
pressure, rheumatic fever, heart murmur, heart attack or
other disorder of the heart or blood vessel” when, in fact,
he was a known hypertensive since 1974;

Art. 1146

,

<

HELD: The RTC’s ruling that the cause of action of private
respondents had not prescribed, is arbitrary and patently
erroneous for not being founded on evidence on record, and,
therefore, the same is void. Consequently, while the CA did not
err in upholding the June 7, 1996 Order of the RTC, it committed
a reversible error when it declared that the RTC did not commit
any grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Order dated Dec.
12, 1997. The CA should have granted the petition for certiorari
assailing said Order of Dec. 12, 1997. Said Order was issued
with grave abuse of discretion for being patently erroneous and
arbitrary, thus, depriving petitioner of due process.
The petition is partly granted. The assailed CA decision
dated April 30, 1999 insofar only as it upheld the Order dated
Dec. 12, 1997 is reversed and set aside. A new judgment is
entered reversing and setting aside the Order dated Dec. 12,
1997 of the RTC of Libmanan, Camarines Sur, Br. 56, and
affirming its Order dated June 20, 1995. Said RTC is directed
to proceed with dispatch with Civil Case L-787.

Upon an oral contract;

to compel the landlord to reinstate the tenant to the land)
comes under Art. 1145 (six years) and not under Art. 1149
(five years) of the Civil Code.
(b) In Belman Compania, Inc. v. Central Bank, L-15044, July
14, 1960, it was held that an action to recover a foreign
exchange tax erroneously collected by the Central Bank
(Bangko Sentral) is one based on the quasi-contract of
solutio indebiti, and it, therefore, prescribes in six years.

[NOTE: In case of persons under guardianship and in
the case of absentees, the period of prescription shall not
begin until the termination of the former’s incapacity, or
until the domicile of the latter is known. (Art. 1389, par.
2, Civil Code)]

Upon a qiuui-delict.

COMMENT:
(1) Actions That Prescribe in Four Years

The Article enumerates two kinds.
Other actions include:
(a) Action for the annulment of marriage based on non-age,
fraud, force, or intimidation. (Art. 87, pars. 1, 4, and 5,
Civil Code)
(b)

Action for the revocation or reduction (this is actually only
for reduction) of donations based on birth, appearance, or
adoption of a child. (Art. 763, Civil Code)
60

Action for the annulment of a contract. (Art. 1391, par. 1,
Civil Code)
[NOTE: In cases of intimidation, violence, or undue
influence, the period is counted from the time the vitiation
ceases (Art. 1391, par. 3, Civil Code); in case of mistake or
fraud, from the time of discovery of the same (Art. 1391,
par. 4, Civil Code); and in cases of contracts entered into
by minors or other incapacitated persons, from the time
the guardianship ceases. (Art. 1391, par. 5, Civil Code)]

(3) Actions Where Periods Are Not Fixed

(1)

Action for rescission of contracts. (Art. 1389, par. 1, Civil

Code)

(a)

Art. 1146. The following actions must be instituted within
four years:

Action to revoke a donation for non-compliance with
conditions imposed by donor upon donee, the period to be
counted from the non-compliance with the said condition.
(Art. 764, Civil Code)

(2) Example of “Injury to the Rights of the Plaintiff”

In Valencia v. Cebu Portland Cement Co., et al., L-13715,
Dec. 23, 1959, a case involving a plaintiff separated from his
employment for alleged unjustifiable causes, the Supreme Court
held that the action is one for “injury to the rights of the plaintiff,
and must be brought within 4 years.”
(3) Rules for Quasi-Delicts
(a)

In a quasi-delict, the period begins from the day the quasi¬
delict was committed.
Paulan, et al. v. Sarabia, et al.
L-10542, July 31, 1958

FACTS: Basco was riding on a bus owned by defendant
Sarabia when it collided with another truck owned by
third-party defendant Lim. Basco died on July 25, 1951.

On April 19, 1955, a complaint against Sarabia and his

and her driver.

of prescription was suspended from Dec. 13, 1949 up to Feb.
16, 1954 (the period when the criminal case was pending).
[NOTE: The ruling stated above is correct if the civil
action is based on the CRIME. If the civil action is based
on a QUASI-DELICT (which is considered an independent
civil action), the institution of the criminal action cannot
have the effect of interrupting the civil action based on such
quasi-delict.(Paulan, et al. v. Sarabia, et al., L-10542, July

ISSUE: From what time must the four-year period be
counted for the filing of the third-party complaint from
the day of the collision or from the filing of the principal
complaint?

—

HELD: The period begins from the day of the collision,
since the action is based on a quasi-delict. The third-party
complaint was therefore dismissed.
(b)

An action for damages arising from physical injuries
because of a tort must be filed within four years. (See
Escueta u. Fandialan, L-39675, Nov. 29, 1974) However,
when a criminal action for the same physical injuries is
instituted, the civil action for recovery of civil liability
arising from the offense charged is impliedly instituted
with the criminal action, unless the offended party
expressly waives the civil action or reserves his right to
institute it separately.

Degollacion v. Li Chui
L-11640, May 22, 1956

FACTS: A traffic accident occurred on Sept. 29,
1949. A criminal case was brought against the defendant’s
driver in the Justice of the Peace Court (now Municipal/
Metropolitan Trial Court) on Dec. 13, 1949. The case was,
however, eventually dismissed, without prejudice, by the
Court of First Instance, on Feb. 16, 1954. Having failed
to have the criminal case reinstated through the fiscal’s
office, the plaintiff filed a civil action for damages against
the defendant’s employer.

HELD: The civil action did not prescribe, it appearing
that the plaintiff neither expressly waived the civil action
nor reserved his right to file a separate civil action. Because
the civil aspect remained with the criminal case, the period

(4) Rule under the Code of Civil Procedure

Under the Code of Civil Procedure, an action to recover
personal property, and an action for the recovery of damages
for taking, retaining, or injuring personal property, can only be
brought within four years after the right of action accrues.
Lapuz v. Sy Uy
L-10079, May 17, 1957

FACTS: In a civil case between the defendant and his
wife, certain jewelries belonging to the plaintiff were alleged to
have been wrongfully attached on Aug. 24, 1943. Unfortunately,
during the liberation, the jewels were looted from the safe of the
sheriff. On April 27, 1952, the plaintiff filed an action for the
recovery of the jewelries or of their value.
ISSUE: Has the action already prescribed?

HELD: The action has prescribed. Whether the case is
considered as one for the recovery of personal property or one
for damages based on a tort, the plaintiff had only four years
from Aug. 24, 1943 or up to Aug. 24, 1947, within which to file
the action against Sy Uy.

year:

(1) For forcible entry and detainer;
(2)

For defamation.

Art 1147

COMMENT:
(1) Actions That Prescribe in One Year
The Article enumerates two kinds. Others include:
(a) An action for legal separation, to be counted from knowledge
of the cause (but the action must be brought within five
years from occurrence). (Art. 102, Civil Code)
[NOTE: Under Art. 57 of the Family Code, the
prescriptive period for filing an action for legal separation
shall be counted from the date of occurrence of the cause.]
(b) Action to impugn the legitimacy of a child, the period to be
counted from the recording of the birth in the Local Civil
Registry, if the husband should be in the same place, or in
a proper case, any of his heirs. (Art. 263, par. 1, Civil Code)
[NOTE: If the husband or his heirs are absent, the
period shall be 18 months if they should reside in the
Philippines; two years if abroad; if the birth of the child is
concealed, the period is to be counted from the discovery
of the fraud. (Art. 263, par. 2, Civil Code)]
(c) Action for the revocation of a donation on the ground of
ingratitude, the period to be counted from the time the
donor had knowledge of the fact, and it was possible for
him to bring the action. (Art. 169, Civil Code)
(d) Action for rescission or for damages for sale of immovable
encumbered with any non-apparent burden or servitude,
the period to be counted from the execution of the deed.
(Art. 1560, par. 3, Civil Code)
(e) Action for damages (no rescission anymore) for sale of
immovable encumbered with any non-apparent burden
or servitude, the one year after the execution of the deed
having lapsed, said period to be counted from the date on
which the burden or servitude is discovered. (Art. 1560,
par. 4, Civil Code)
(2) Rule in Case of Forcible Entry and Detainer

In forcible entry, the period is counted from date of unlawful
deprivation (Sec. 1, Rule 70, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure); in

case of fraud or stealth, counted from discovery of the same.
In unlawful detainer, the period is to be counted from the date
of last demand. (Sarona, et al. v. Villegas, L-22984, March 2,
1968; DBP v. Canonoy, L-29422, Sept. 30, 1970; and Calipayan
v. Pascual, L-22645, Sept. 18, 1967)
(3) Rule in Case of Libel

In libel, while it is true that the written defamation becomes
actionable upon its publication (i.e., communication to third
person), still the libelous matter must first be exhibited to the
person libelled before the action can be brought. Hence, the
one-year period runs from the time the offended party knows of
the libelous matter. A person defamed can hardly be expected
to institute proceedings for damages arising from libel when he
has no knowledge of the said libel. (Alcantara, et al. v. Amoranto,
L-12493, Feb. 29, 1960)
(4) Actions That Prescribe in Six Months

(a)

Action for the reduction of the price or for rescission of a
sale of real estate (by the unit area) if the vendor is unable
to deliver on demand all that is stated in the contract. (Art.
1543, in re Art. 1539, Civil Code)

(b)

Action for reduction of the price or for rescission of a sale
(a cuerpo cierto) of real estate (made with mention of

The prescriptive period provided for in the Tax Code is

Government presents no evidence that the taxpayer received a

of the plaintiffs, still to attain that goal, they must first
travel over the road of relief on the ground of fraud. (Rone
v. Claro and Baquiring, 91 Phil. 250) Indeed, the plaintiffs
cannot be declared as still the owners of the property,
entitled to its possession, without annulling the contract
of sale. Said contract cannot be annulled without declaring
it fraudulent, and annulment on this ground cannot be
done anymore in view of the prescription. (Raymundo v.
De Guzman, L-109020, Dec. 29, 1959)
(b) An action for reconveyance of land,
for which a patent
had been issued to the defendant by reason of fraudulent

Tolentino v. Court of Appeals and David
L-41427, June 10, 1988

(2) Rules in Case of Fraud
(a)

Art. 1149

The action for relief on the ground of fraud may be brought
within four years from the discovery of the fraud. (Art.
1391, Civil Code; and Sec. 43[3], Act 190) Thus, where the
plaintiffs filed an action in 1953 to annul a contract of sale
on the ground that they had been fraudulently induced to
sign the same in the belief that it was a mortgage, although
they discovered the fraud in 1945, the same is barred.
(Raymundo v. Afable, L-7651, Feb. 28, 1955) A subsequent
action by the same plaintiffs against the same defendants
for the recovery of title and possession of the real property,
subject matter of the aforementioned contract of sale is
likewise barred. While it may be true that the recovery of
the title and possession of the lot were ultimate objectives
66

All actions, unless an exception is provided, have
a prescriptive period. Unless the law makes an action
imprescriptible, it is subject to bar by prescription and the period
of prescription is five years from the time the right of action
accrues when no other period is prescribed by law. The Civil
Code provides for some rights which are not extinguished by
prescription, but an action against a woman who has been legally
divorced from her husband, brought by the latter’s present wife,
seeking to enjoin the former wife from using the surname of her
former husband, is not one of them. Neither is there a special
law providing for imprescriptibility.
The mere fact that the supposed violation of the petitioner’s
right may be a continuous one does not change the principle
67

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1150

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

that the moment the breach of right or duty occurs, the right of
action accrues and the action from that moment can be legally
instituted. It is the legal possibility of bringing the action which
determines the starting point for the computation of the period
of prescription. The petitioner should have brought legal action
immediately against the private respondent after she gained
knowledge of the use by the private respondent of the surname
of her former husband.

(e) In an action to recover payment of the difference between
the wages paid an employee and that fixed by the Minimum

(4) Some Cases

Lichauco v. Soriano
35 Phil. 203

FACTS: A promise to pay within one year was made. At
the option of the creditor, the period could be extended for one
year. The debtor failed to pay, and the creditor failed to demand.
ISSUE: From what time will the prescriptive period run?
HELD: Mere delay by the debtors and failure to demand
by the creditor does not mean that the extension of one year had
been granted. Therefore, since the debt became due at the end
of the original year, the prescriptive period should commence
from said end of the first year.
Varela v. Marajas, et al.
L-19215, April 30, 1958

FACTS: The heirs of a deceased person settled the estate
in a written agreement dated Feb. 14, 1941, providing that one
of them would pay an absent heir, upon the reappearance of
the latter. Said absent heir returned to the Philippines from
the United States in November 1945. He immediately asked
for his share, but was not paid. He then filed the complaint for
payment of his share on Dec. 6, 1954.
ISSUE: From what time should the prescriptive period be
counted?

HELD: The prescriptive period should be counted from
November, 1945, when he presented himself for payment but
was not paid. Hence, the action has not yet prescribed. It is
unfair to begin computing from 1941 when the agreement was
made. This is so, because the agreement provided for payment
upon his appearance, and no period was fixed for said purposes.
The situation is similar to that of a debt evidenced by a written
document payable within a stated period, where the cause of
action would accrue only upon the expiration of the stipulated
period in case payment is not made
certainly, not from the
date of the agreement.

Intestate Estate of Francisco Ubat, et al. v.
Atanasia Ubat de Montes, PNB, et al.
L-11633, Jan. 31, 1961

FACTS: Eduardo Ubat borrowed P460 from the Philippine
National Bank in 1936, payable “on or before the 7th day of
October, 1946.” The contract further provided that the payment
“shall be made” in ten equal yearly installments. Suit for the
whole amount was brought in 1954 since not a single installment
had been paid.
ISSUE: Has the debt prescribed?

HELD: Under Art. 1150 of the new Civil Code, the
prescriptive period starts from the time creditor may file an
action, not from the time he wishes to do so. The payment
of yearly installments was mandatory because of the phrase
“shall be made.” Therefore, the prescriptive period for EACH
installment should start from the time it became due. However,
considering the suspensive effect of the Moratorium Law, only
the first five installments have prescribed. The others may still
be recovered.

is generally final and immediately executory. (Enrique v. Padilla,

this reason, prescription begins (or tolls) not from the date of
its entry, but from the date of its rendition. (Dirige v. Biranya,

Art. 1152. The period for prescription of actions to

COMMENT:
Obligations Declared by a Judgment

The Article explains itself.
Luzon Surety Co. v. IAC
GR 72645, June 30, 1987

It is now settled that the ten-year period within which an
action for revival of a judgment should be brought, commences
to run from the date of finality of the judgment, and not from
the expiration of the five-year period within which the judgment
may be enforced by mere motion.
Three reasons were advanced, to wit:
(1) Section 447 of the Code of Civil Procedure (which
is similar to the last sentence of Sec. 6, Rule 39 of the Revised
Rules of Court) should be construed in relation to Sec. 43, No. 1
of the said Code (which is similar to Art. 1144 of the Civil Code);
and as thus construed, the conclusion one arrives at is that after
the expiration of the five years within which execution can be
issued upon a judgment, the winning party can revive it only in
the manner therein provided so long as the period of ten years

72

Art. 1153

does not expire from the date of said judgment, according to Sec.
43, No. 1 of the same Code.
(2) The right of the winning party to enforce the judgment
against the defeated party “begins to exist the moment the
judgment is final; and this right, according to our Code of Civil
Procedure, consists in having an execution of the judgment issued
during the first five years next following, and in commencing
after that period the proceeding provided in Sec. 447 to revive it,
and this latter remedy can be pursued only before the judgment
prescribes, that is to say, during the five years next following.
It is so much an action to ask for an execution as it is to file a
complaint for reviving it, because, as we know, by action is meant
the legal demand of the right or rights one may have.”
(3) If it is held that the winning party has still ten years
within which to revive the judgment after the expiration of
five years, then the judgment would not prescribe until after
15 years, which is against No. 1 of Sec. 43 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. It cannot be said that such is the letter, and much
less, the intention of the law, for there is nothing in Sec. 447
of the said Code, making this new period different from the
one prescribed in said Sec. 43, No. 1, or reconciling these two
provisions, there being no other way of reconciling them than to
say that after the expiration of the first five years next following
the judgment, there remains to the victorious party only another
five years to review it.

Art. 1153. The period for prescription of action to demand
accounting runs from the day the persons who should render
the same cease in their functions.

The period for the action arising from the result of
the accounting runs from the date when said result was
recognized by agreement of the interested parties.

(1) Old Law Re Interruption of Prescriptive Periods

Under the old law, while it is true that the prescription
of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the court,
still, if the case is dismissed without any unfavorable judgment
against the defendants, even if without prejudice to another
action, the same does not constitute an interruption of the
period of prescription for the parties are in exactly the same
position. (Ongsiako v. Ongsiako, L-7510, March 30, 1957) This
doctrine was reiterated in Amar u. Odianan, L-15179, Sept. 30,
1960. Moreover, according to the Court, Act 190 contains NO
provisions on the interruption or suspension of the period of
prescription by the mere institution of an action.

or acknowledgment. Thus, a written offer of payment works
as a renewal of the obligation and prevents prescription from
setting in. (Phil. National Bank v. Hipolito, L-16463, Jan. 30,
1965) Thus also, an oral or verbal acknowledgment has been
held insufficient to interrupt or suspend the running of the
prescriptive period. Like the Statute of Frauds, the plain purpose
of the law is to avoid uncertainty in the determination of the
periods of limitation, and not leave such determination on the
fallacies of human memory. This was also the rule under the
old rule. (Sec. 50 of Act 190)

It would be different, however, if such oral acknowledgment
assumes a new obligation, and is not merely a promise to pay an
old debt at a future time. (Borromeo v. Zaballero, L-14357, Aug.
31, 1960) Written extrajudicial demands made AFTER an action
has prescribed do NOT of course revive the action. (Belman Co.,
Inc. v. Central Bank, L- 15044, May 30, 1960)
(4) Moratorium Law Suspended Right to Sue

The Moratorium Law suspended the creditor’s right to
sue, and for purposes of prescription, the time it was in force
must be excluded from the computation. (Magdalena, et al. v.
75

Art. 1155

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Benedicto, L-9105, Feb. 28, 1958; Talens, et cd. v. Chuakay &
Co., GR L-10127, June 30, 1958; Rio & Co. v. Datu Jolkipli, GR
L-12301, April 13, 1959; Levy Hermanos v. Perez, GR L-14487,
April 29, 1960) BUT the Moratorium Law does not apply to
pre-war debts. (Nielsen & Co., Inc. v. Lepanto, L-21661, Dec.

28, 1968)

(5) Effect of President Osmena’s Moratorium Order (EO 32),
and the Moratorium Law (RA 342), upon the Statute of

Limitations for Debts Contracted Before Dec. 31, 1941
If the debtor was a WAR DAMAGE claimant, the period
of prescription was suspended from March 10, 1945 (Ex.
Order No. 32) to May 18, 1953 (when the decision in Rutter
v. Esteban, 49 O.G. 1807, holding unconstitutional the
further operation of RA 342 became operative). [Note that in
said Rutter case, the Moratorium Law was not declared void
ab initio\ the Court only held that its continued operation
and enforcement had already become unreasonable and
oppressive. Said law therefore suspended the Statute
of Limitations, and no action for collection could be
maintained during the period when it was still in effect.
(Vda. de Quiambao v. Manila Motor Co., Inc., L-l 7384, Jan.
30, 1962)] Whether or not the creditor actually brought his
suit before or after the Rutter decision, the period for the
enforcement of the credit was tolled or suspended. (Ibid.)
The presumption is that the creditor was a war damage
claimant. (Rio y Compania v. Court of Appeals, L-l 5666,

(a)

(b)

June 30, 1962)
If the debtor was NOT a war damage claimant, the period
of prescription was suspended from March 10, 1945 (EO
32) to July 26, 1948 [when the Moratorium Law, RA 342,
became effective]. (Rio &Co. v. Datu Jolkipli, GR L-12301,

April 13, 1959; see Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp,
v. Pauli, L-15713, March 31, 1962)
(6) Closure of Courts during the Japanese Occupation

Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that the regular
courts were closed or ceased to function with the overrunning of
Luzon by the Japanese forces in Dec. 1941. They did not reopen
until Jan. 30, 1942. This interruption in the functions of the
76

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1155

courts naturally suspended also the running of the prescriptive
period. (Talens, et al. v. Chuakay and Co., GR L-10127, June 30,
1958)

(7) Actions under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act

The interruption by a written extrajudicial demand does
not apply to actions under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act,
which must be filed within one year from receipt of the cargo.
The reason is that matters affecting transportation of goods by
sea should be decided in as short a time as possible. To apply
the Civil Code provision would permit delays. (Yek Tong Lin
Fire Ins. Co. v. American President Lines, Inc., L-11081, April
30, 1958)
Dole Phils., Inc. v. Maritime Co. of the Phils.
GR 61352, Feb. 27, 1987
In a case governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the
general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure on Prescription
should not be made to apply. Similarly, in such a case, Art. 1155
cannot be made to apply, as such application would have the
effect of extending the one-year period of prescription fixed in
the law. It is desirable that matters affecting transportation
of goods by sea be decided in as short a time as possible. Thus,
the application of Art. 1155 would unnecessarily extend the
period and permit delays in the settlement of question affecting
transportation, contrary to the clear intent and purpose of the
law.
(8) Rule in Taxation Cases

The motion for reconsideration of a decision of the Collector
of Internal Revenue suspends the running of the prescriptive
period within which the taxpayer may appeal to the Court
of Tax Appeals; and the period resumes its running the day
following the receipt by the taxpayer of the Collector’s denial
of said motion. (Collector of Internal Revenue v. Convention of
Philippine Baptist Churches, L-11807, Jan. 28, 1961)
(9) Effect of a Motion for Reconsideration

A motion for reconsideration on the ground that the decision
is completely against the evidence and the law, without pointing
77

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1156

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

out the finding and pronouncement made in the judgment that
were allegedly contrary to the evidence and the law is pro forma
and does not stop the running of the period within which to
appeal (Valdez v. Jugo, 74 Phil. 49 and Villaion v. Ysip, 53 O.G.
1094); and the fact that before entry of the order denying the
motion for reconsideration, the movants filed a pleading where
they pointed out the fraud allegedly committed, does not cure
the defect of such motion. (Garganta, et al. v. Court of Appeals,
et al., L-12104, March 31, 1959)

.

case before the Davao RTC with the same cause of action, be
it noted that litis pendentia cannot apply in an instance where
there is no identity of parties.

In the case at bar, records show and as admitted by
petitioner, the action filed in the Manila RTC was against the
respondent while the case filed in the Davao RTC was against
DATICOR, the president of which is the respondent. The first
case is against a natural person, while the second, is against a
juridical person.

Buccat v. Dispo
L-44338, April 15, 1988

The Court held that it was only on Nov. 1972 that the cause
of action for the fixing of the period of lease accrued. This is as it
should be because prior to that, the validity of the second contract
of lease was being challenged. The case for unlawful detainer
filed by the plaintiff-appellee became in fact a case questioning
the validity of the second contract on the grounds that the said
contract was simulated and that there was no consideration.
The plaintiff-appellee could not have been expected to file an
action for the fixing of the period of the lease before the Court of
Appeals promulgated its decision because she was not yet aware
that the said paragraph of the second contract was a provision
that called for an indefinite period. For the reason that the very
existence, and subsequently, the interpretation of the second
contract of lease, particularly par. 3 thereof, were put in issue
in the unlawful detainer case, the court trying the case was
required to interpret the provisions of, and consequently, rule
on the validity of, the said contract.

(10) Some Cases

In order to resolve whether or not the present action has
prescribed, it is necessary to first determine when the right of
action for the fixing of the period of lease accrued. Should it be
reckoned from the time when the parties entered into the second
contract of lease which was on Aug. 1959 as the defendantsappellants claim, or at the time when the decision of the Court of
Appeals upholding the validity of the second contract of lease was
promulgated which was on Nov. 1972 as the plaintiff-appellee
claims?

Montero v. Times
GR 190828, March 16, 2015
ISSUE: Is an illegal dismissal case subject to the fourth-

. year prescriptive prior under Art. 1155 of the Civil Code?

HELD: While the filing of a labor case could have inter¬
rupted the running of the four-year prescriptive period, the vol¬
untary withdrawal of said case effectively cancelled the telling of
the prescriptive period within which to file an illegal dismissal
case, leaving it in exactly the same position as though no labor
case has been filed at all.

(3) Concept of Prestation (BAR QUESTION)

A prestation is an obligation; more specifically, it is the
subject matter of an obligation and may consist of giving a
thing, doing or not doing a certain act. The law speaks of an
obligation as a juridical necessity to comply with a prestation.
There ia a “juridical necessity,’ for non-compliance can result
in juridical or legal sanction.

Mataas na Lupa Tenants’
Association v. Carlos Dimayuga
and Juliana Diego Vda. de Gabriel
L-32049, June 25, 1984
Under PD 1517, tenants-lessees are given pre-emptive or
preferential rights (right of first refusal) if they have occupied
the land or lot for over ten years. The owner has this obligation
to grant said preference. Thus, he cannot sell to a third person
without first offering the same to the lessee. If the latter
renounces said right, the waiver must be in a public instrument.
(4) Kinds of Obligations

There are various basis for the classification of obligations.
Given hereunder are few of them:
(a) From the viewpoint of ‘sanction’

1)
2)
3)

civil obligation (or perfect obligation)
natural obligation
moral obligation (or imperfect obligation)

—

Definitions
a) civil obligation that defined in Art. 1156. The
sanction is judicial process. Example: A promises
to pay B his (A’s) debt of Pl million.
b) natural obligation
the duty not to recover
what has voluntarily been paid although
payment was no longer required. Example: A
owes B Pl million. But the debt has already
prescribed. If A, knowing that it has prescribed,
nevertheless still pays B, he (A) cannot later on

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

get back what he voluntarily paid. The sanction
is the law of course, but only because conscience
had originally motivated the payment.
c)

(5) Criticism of the Definition by the Code

Article 1156 defines obligation as “a juridical necessity
to give, to do, or not to do.” As will be noticed, this stresses

—

moral obligation the duty of a Catholic to hear
mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation.
The sanction here is conscience or morality, or
the law of the church.

merely the duty of the debtor (the passive element) without
emphasizing a corresponding right on the part of the creditor
(the active element). On this point, Justice J.B.L. Reyes of the
Supreme Court has remarked: “This definition, taken from
Sanchez Roman is incomplete, in that, it views obligations
only from the debit side. There is no debt without a credit, and
the credit is an asset in the patrimony of the creditor just as
the debt is a liability of the obligor. Following the defective
method of the Spanish Civil Code, the new Code separates
responsibility from the other element of obligation.” (Lawyer's
Journal, Jan. 31, 1951, p. 47) He then quotes with approval the
following definition given by Arias Ramos:

[NOTE: If a Catholic promises to hear mass
for ten consecutive Sundays in order to receive
Pl million this obligation becomes a civil one.]
(b) From the viewpoint of subject matter
the obligation to give
1) real obligation
the obligation to do or not to
2)
personal obligation
do
(Example: the duty to paint a house, or to refrain
from committing a nuisance)
(c) From the affirmativeness and negativeness of the obliga¬
tion
1)
positive or affirmative obligation the obligation to
give or to do
2)
negative obligation the obligation not to do (which
naturally includes “not to give”)

— —

—

(d)

—

“An obligation is a juridical relation whereby a person
(called the creditor) may demand from another (called the
debtor) the observance of a determinative conduct (the giving,

doing, or not doing), and in case of breach, may demand
satisfaction from the assets of the latter.”

—

[NOTE: This definition is accurate because it views
“obligation” from a “total” standpoint (both active and passive
viewpoint).]

Poss v. Gottlieb
193 N.Y.S. 418
FACTS: There were two partners engaged in buying and
reselling land. After they had bought a piece of land, one asked
the other to sell the latter’s share to him for the price invested
by the latter. The first partner, who now completely owned the
land, resold it at a huge profit to a third person. The second
partner would not have sold his share had he known that a big
offer had been made by such third person. The first partner
alleged that he should not be blamed on the ground that he,
after all did not make any false concealment to his partner,
that is, he did not tell the latter that nobody wanted the land.
ISSUE: May the second partner successfully bring an
action for damages against the first partner?
HELD: Yes, because the first partner is liable. He had the
duty not only to make any false concealment but also to abstain
from all kinds of concealment insofar as the partnership was
concerned. This is an obligation to do (to relay all pertinent
information).

Joaquin P. Nemenzo v. Bernabe Sabillano
L-20977, Sept. 7, 1968

FACTS: A municipal mayor, upon assumption of office,
arbitrarily dismissed a corporal (a civil service eligible) in the
police force of the municipality, without due investigation.
ISSUE: Is the mayor personally liable?
HELD: Yes, because his act of dismissing the corporal
without previous administrative investigation and without
justifiable cause is clearly an injury to the corporal’s rights. The
mayor cannot hide under the mantle of his official capacity and
pass the liability to the municipality of which he was mayor.
There are altogether too many cases of this nature, wherein
local elective officials, upon assumption of office, wield their
new-found power indiscriminately by replacing employees
with their own proteges, regardless of the laws and regulations
governing the civil service. Victory at the polls should not be
taken as authority for the commission of such illegal acts.

(7) In an Option to Buy, Payment of Purchase Price by

Creditor Is Contingent upon Execution and Delivery of
a Deed of Sale by Debtor
Obligations under an option to buy are reciprocal
obligations. Performance of one obligation is conditioned on the
simultaneous fulfillment of the other obligation. In other words,
in an option to buy, payment of purchase price by creditor is
contingent upon the execution and delivery of a deed of sale
by the debtor. (Heirs of Luis Bacus, et al. u. CA and Spouses

invoked, a simple motion in the same proceeding will

While obligations arising from a contract have the force

inferior to contracts. This is because before a contract can be
enforced, it must first be valid, and it cannot be valid if it is
against the law. Moreover, the right of the parties to stipulate is

parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and
conditions as they may deem convenient, provided, they are not

As long as Art. 1306 is complied with, the contract should
be given effect, even if at the time it was entered into, no legal
provision existed governing it. (Quizana v. Redugerio, 50 O.G.

of constitutional rights would result. (People v. Pomar, 46 Phil.
440) Nevertheless, in contracts where public interest is involved
(as in the case of labor agreements), the government has a right
to intervene for the protection of the whole. (Leyte Land Trans.
v. Leyte Farmer’s Union, GR L-1977, May 12, 1948)

An obligation is the result of a contract (or some other
source). Hence, while a contract, if valid, always results in
!

obligations, not all obligations come from contracts. A contract
always presupposes a meeting of the minds; this is not
necessarily true for all kinds of obligations.

Be it noted, however, from another viewpoint that a contract
may itself be the result of an obligation. Thus, ifP engages A as
the former’s agent, we have the contract of agency. As an agent,
A has the obligation, say to look around for clients or buyers, as
in the real estate business. As a result of such obligation, A may
enter into a contract of sale with C, a customer. The contract of
sale itself results in the obligations to pay and to deliver. The
obligation to deliver may result in a contract of carriage, and so
on, ad infinitum.

(5) Some Decided Cases

De los Reyes v. Alejado
16 Phil. 499

FACTS: A borrower agreed to pay his debt, and in case of
non-payment, to render free service as a servant.
ISSUE: Is the obligation valid?
HELD: The obligation to pay is, of course, valid and cannot
be questioned but the undertaking to render domestic services
for free is contrary to law and morals, for here, slavery would
result. (NOTE: If, however, the “free” services will be rendered
in satisfaction of the debt, the stipulation can be given effect, for
here the services will not really be gratuitous. Even in this case,
however, specific performance of the service will not be a proper
remedy for non-compliance. Instead, an action for damages of
payment of the debt should be brought.)
Molina v. De la Riva
6 Phil. 12
FACTS: The parties in a case agreed to go to court in Albay,
although another Court has jurisdiction.
HELD: The agreement is null and void, for jurisdiction is
conferred by law, and not by the will of the parties.

Bachrach v. Golingco
39 Phil. 138
ISSUE: If there is an express written contract for fees
between an attorney and his client, may the court still disregard
the contract?
HELD: Yes, because a contract for attorney’s fees is
different from other contracts. It may be disregarded if the
amount fixed is unconscionable or unreasonable, considering
the value of the work accomplished.
[NOTE: A claim for attorney’s fees may be asserted either
in the very action in which the services in question have been
rendered, or in a separate action. If the first alternative is chosen,

Art. 1159

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the court may pass upon said claim even if its amount were less
than the minimum prescribed by law for the jurisdiction of the
court over the subject matter of the case for so long as the main
action is within the jurisdiction of said court, upon the theory
that the right to recover attorney’s fees is but an INCIDENT of
the case in which the services of counsel have been rendered.
(Maria Reyes de Tolentino v. Godofredo Escalono, et al., L26556,
Jan. 24, 1960; see Palanca v. Pecson, 94 Phil. 419; and Dahlke
v. Vina, 51 PhU. 707)]

Conrado v. Judge Tan
51 O.G. 2923, June 1955
FACTS: In a validly made contract, some provisions were
later on inserted by a falsifier.
ISSUE: Is the whole contract void?
HELD: Only the additional provision should be disregarded,
and the original terms should be considered valid and subsisting.
Alcantara v. Alinea
8 Phil. Ill

FACTS: A borrowed from B P480 and agreed that in case
of non-payment on the date stipulated, A’s house and lot would
be sold to B for the amount of P480.

ISSUE: Is the stipulation valid?
HELD: Yes, and if A does not pay, A should sell the house
and lot for P480. The agreement is not contrary to law. (See also
Quizana v. Redugerio, 50 O.G. 2444, June, 1954)
[NOTE: It seems to the author that the stipulation may
be considered void as being a pactum commissorium, unless A
be allowed, instead of selling, to select the option of still being
indebted, with consequential damages or interest.]
Ganzon v. Judge Sancho
GR 56450, July 23, 1983

If a mortgage is substituted by a guaranty or surety bond
without the consent of all the required parties, the contract may
be said to be impaired.

Ollendorf v. Abrahamson
38 Phil. 585

FACTS: Ollendorf, needlework manufacturer, hired
Abrahamson for two years, on the condition that for five
years, the latter should not engage in competitive needlework
manufacture. After one year, the latter left for reasons of health.
Shortly afterwards, after regaining his health, he competed with
his former employer, who now seeks to restrain him from such
competition. The defendant argues that the restriction is void,
because it is an unreasonable restraint of trade.
HELD: The agreement was valid, and is a reasonable
restraint, considering that it was only for five years. Inasmuch
as it is enforceable and has the rule of law between the parties,
the defendant can be properly restricted.
Herminia Goduco v. Court of Appeals, et al.
L-17647, Feb. 28, 1964
If upon the promise of the son-in-law of a seller, an agent
sells on commission a parcel of land to a buyer, said buyer, not
having promised to give said commission, is NOT liable therefor.
Payment of the commission must be sought from whoever made
the promise to pay such amount, namely, the son-in-law of the
seller.

Molave Motor Sales, Inc.
v. Laron and Geminiano
L-65377, May 28, 1984

When an employee in a car repair shop has his own car
repaired therein and purchases certain spare parts, his liability
therefor is governed by the Civil Code, not the Labor Code.
Therefore, it is the civil courts, not the Ministry (Department)
of Labor, that has jurisdiction over the case.

Borcena, et al. v. IAC
GR 70099, Jan. 7, 1987
Contracts for attorney’s services stand upon an entirely
different footing from contracts for the payment of compensation
for any other services. An attorney is not entitled, in the

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1159

absence of express contract, to recover more than a reasonable
compensation for his services. And even when an express
contract is made, the court can ignore it and limit the recovery
of reasonable compensation if the amount of the stipulated fee
is found by the court to be unreasonable. This is a very different
rule from that announced in Sec. 1091 of the Civil Code of Spain
(now Art. 1159, Civil Code) with reference to the obligation of
contracts in general, where it is said that such obligation has
the force of law between the contracting parties.
PNB v. Se, Jr.
70 SCAD 323
(1996)

As contracts, warehouse receipts must be respected by
authority of Art. 1159 of the Civil Code.

A prior judgment holding that a party is a warehouseman
obligated to deliver sugar stocks covered by the Warehouse
Receipts does not necessarily carry with it a denial of the
warehouseman’s lien over the same sugar stocks. Even in the
absence of a provision in the Warehouse Receipts, law and equity
dictate the payment of the warehouseman’s lien pursuant to
Secs. 27 and 31 of the Warehouse Receipts Law.
A party is in estoppel in disclaiming liability for the
payment of storage fees due the warehouseman while claiming to
be entitled to the sugar stocks covered by the subject Warehouse
Receipts on the basis of which it anchors its claim for payment
or delivery of the sugar stocks. Imperative is the right of the
warehouseman to demand payment of his lien because he loses
his lien upon goods by surrendering possession thereof.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
St. Luke’s Medical Center, Inc.
817 SCRA 347

Vicente Aldaba v. Court of Appeals, et al.
L-21676, Feb. 28, 1969
FACTS: Dr. Vicente Aldaba and his daughter, Dr. Jane
Aldaba, rendered services to Belen Aldaba, a rich woman
of Malolos, Bulacan for ten years without receiving any
compensation. It was admitted that for such services, the two
doctors did NOT expect to be paid.
ISSUES: Was there a contract, whether express or implied?
Was Belen obliged to compensate the two doctors?

As to whether St Luke’s Medical Center, Inc. (SLMC) is
liable for compromise penalty under Sec. 248(A) of the 1997
National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) for its alleged failure
to file its quarterly income tax returns, this has also been re¬
solved in GR 195909 and 195960 (CIR v. SLMC, 682 SCRA 66
[2012]), where the imposition of mischarges and interest under
Secs. 248-249 of the 1997 NIRC were deleted on the basis of
good faith and honest belief on the part of SLMC that it is not
subject to tax.

HELD: There was no contract, whether express or implied,
and therefore Belen was not obliged to compensate the two
doctors; no express contract, for nothing on this point was agreed
upon; and no implied contract, for the doctors did not expect
to be paid for their services. When a person does not expect to
be paid for his services, there cannot be a contract implied in
fact to give compensation for such services. To give rise to an
implied contract to pay for services, said services must have
been rendered by one party in expectation that the other party
would pay for them and must have been accepted by the other
party with knowledge of that expectation. (See 58 Am Jur, p.
512, and the cases cited therein)

Art. 1160. Obligations derived from quasi-contracts shall

(2017)

COMMENT:
(1) ‘Quasi-Contract’ Defined

A quasi-contract is that juridical relation resulting from
a lawful, voluntary, and unilateral act, and which has for its
purpose the payment of indemnity to the end that no one shall
be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another. (See
Art. 2142, Civil Code)
(2) The Two Principal Kinds

(7) Basis of ‘Good Faith’

The determination of whether good faith is present is a
factual matter. (Land Bank v. Musni, 818 SCRA 442 [2017]) Good
faith implies the lack of any intentions to commit a wrongdoing.
Based on the totality of one’s acts and actuations, claims of good
faith and lack of intent to commit a wrong cannot be probable. ( Office
of the Court Administrator v. Yu, 820 SCRA 256 [2017])
Good faith, or want of it, is capable of being sustained only
from the acts of one claiming its presence, for it is a condition of the
mind which can be judged by actual or fancied token or signs. (Miles
v. Lao, 846 SCRA 281 [2017])

(5) Query: Is a Quasi-Contract an Implied Contract?

This takes place when something is received when there
is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through
mistake. The recipient has the duty to return it. (Example: If I
let a storekeeper change my P50.00 bill and by error he gives
me P50.60, 1 have the duty to return the extra P0.60.) (See Art.
2154, Civil Code)

City of Cebu v. Piccio and Caballero
L-13012 and 14876, Dec. 31, 1960
FACTS: Caballero, an employee of the City of Cebu who
has been illegally dismissed, sued for backwages by way of
mandamus and made as defendants thereto the City Mayor, the
Municipal Board, the City Treasurer, and the City Auditor of
Cebu City, BUT the City of Cebu itself was not made a defendant.
When Caballero was later paid, the City of Cebu brought an
action for the REFUND of the payment on the ground that the
payment was illegal because the City of Cebu had NOT been
made a party to Caballero’s mandamus case.
HELD: The City of Cebu CANNOT recover. The claim for
refund is predicated on “solutio indebiti." The requisites for this
are: (a) he who paid was NOT under obligation to do so; (b) the
payment was made by reason of an essential mistake of fact.
These requisites are NOT present because Caballero has a right
to be paid and no mistake was made. The fact that the City
itself was NOT a party is immaterial for a judgment against a
municipal officer, sued in his official capacity, BINDS the City.
The acts of the duly authorized officials bind the principal the

UST Cooperative Store v. City of Manila, et al.
L-17133, Dec. 31, 1965
FACTS: The UST Cooperative Store, which is tax-exempt
under RA 2023 (The Philippine Non-Agricultural Cooperative
Act) because its assets are not more than P500,000 paid taxes
to the City of Manila, not knowing that it was tax-exempt.
ISSUE: May it successfully ask for a refund?
HELD: Yes, because the payment is not considered
voluntary in character. Clearly, the payment was made under
a mistake. (See 51 Am Jur 1023)

ANS.: No, because in a quasi-contract (unlike in an implied
contract), there is NO meeting of the minds.
(6) Other Examples of Quasi-Contracts

When during a fire, flood, or other calamity, property is
saved from destruction by another person without the
knowledge of the owner, the latter is bound to pay the
former just compensation. (Art. 2168, Civil Code)

shall be entitled to reimbursement from the latter. (Art.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1161

Badiong v. Judge Apalisok
GR 60151, June 24, 1983

Although the defendant in a criminal case has already
pleaded guilty, and has filed an application for probation, the
court should still set the case for hearing to receive the offended
party’s evidence on the civil liability of the accused. If this would
not be done, the offended party will be denied due process.
(2) Pertinent Provision of the Revised Penal Code

Article 100, R.P.C. says: “Every person criminally liable
felony
is also civilly liable.” The reason lies in the fact that
for a
oftentimes the commission of a crime causes not only moral evil
but also material damage. If no material damage is done, civil
liability cannot be enforced. (See Albert, Rev. Penal Code, Vol.
I,pp. 407-408)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: Article 101 of the Revised Penal Code prescribes the
subsidiary liability of the parents in case of a minor over nine
but under 15 who DID NOT act with discernment. If he acted
WITH discernment, the Revised Penal Code is silent because he
is criminally liable. In that case, resort is made to the general
law which is the Civil Code, Art. 2080 of which applies. Under
said Article, the parents would be held liable unless they can
prove due supervision. To hold that the Civil Code does not
apply because it covers only obligations arising from negligence
or quasi-delicts would result in an ABSURDITY for, while in a
negligent act, the parents are subsidiarily liable for the damage
caused by their son, no liability would attach if the damage is
caused with criminal intent. It is clear, therefore, that applying
Art. 2080 of the Civil Code, the parents would ordinarily be
liable.
(5) What Civil Liability Arising from a Crime Includes

Elcano v. Hill
77 SCRA 98

(a)

An accused in a criminal case may be sued CIVILLY
whether or not he is found guilty or is acquitted. But the victim
cannot recover damages in both cases (only in one).

(c)

(3) Liability of an Insane Criminal

An insane man who commits a crime is exempted from
criminal liability, but his guardian can be held civilly liable
unless the latter was diligent in his task of taking care of the
insane. If there is no guardian, or if said guardian (in the proper
case) is insolvent, the property of the insane man can be made
liable. (See Arts. 12 and 101, R.P.C.)
(4) Case

Sales v. Balce
L-14414, April 27, 1960

FACTS: The son of the plaintiff was killed by the minor son
(below 15) of the defendant. The son who acted with discernment
was convicted, but had no money.
ISSUE: Are his parents subsidiarily liable?

Art. 1161

(b)

restitution;
reparation of the damage caused;
indemnification for consequential damages. (Art. 104, Rev.
Penal Code)

[NOTE: In the case of People v. Rodriguez, GR L-6592,
July 29, 1956, it was held that if a criminal is convicted
without the court declaring his civil liability and he
immediately commences serving sentence, the court may
still grant indemnity, upon motion of the victim, three
days after the criminal began to serve sentence, because
the judgment has not yet become final, for the period to
appeal has not yet prescribed. In another case, People v.
Mostasesa, GR L-5684, Jan. 22, 1954, it was held that if
a person commits a crime by taking something, he cannot
discharge his civil liability by offering to give a similar
thing. He must pay the price, for the civil liability arising
from a crime is not governed by the Civil Code but by Arts.
100-111, Rev. Penal Code.)
(6) Effect of Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances

In crimes, the damages to be adjudicated may be,
respectively, increased or lessened according to the aggravating
or mitigating circumstances. (Art. 2204, Civil Code)
101

Art. 1161

Art. 1161

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(7) Damages in Case of Death

In addition to other damages, if a crime results in death,
Art. 2206 of the Civil Code states that at least P3,000 must be
given to the heirs of the victim. However, said minimum amount
has now been raised to P50,000 in view of the decreasing value
of the peso. (Loss of earning capacity and moral damages, among
other things, should be given.)
(8) Civil Action Implicitly Instituted in Criminal Case

As a general rule, whenever a criminal action is instituted,
the civil action for the civil liability is also impliedly instituted
together with the criminal action. (See Rule 3, Sec. 1, Revised
Rules of Court)
(9) Effect of Death of the Criminal Offender Pending Trial

Buenaventura Belamala v.
Marcelino Polinar
L-24098, Nov. 18, 1967
FACTS: The defendant in a criminal case for physical
injuries died before final judgment.
ISSUE: Is his civil liability extinguished?
HELD: No, his civil liability is not extinguished for, after
all, in Art. 33 of the Civil Code, there can, in the case of physical
injuries, still be an independent civil action. The action will be
directed against the administrator of the estate, the obligation
having become the obligation of the heirs; but of course the
liability cannot exceed the value of the inheritance. (Art. 774,
Civil Code) Incidentally, as already said, the remedy is an action
against the administrator, and not merely a claim against the
estate. The reason is because the purpose is to recover damages
for an injury to person or property (hence, extra-contractual as
it arose from either a crime or a tort). (See Aguas v. Llemos,
L-18107, Aug. 30, 1962) Had the liability been contractual, a
mere claim against the estate would have sufficed. (See Leung
Ben v. O’Brien, 38 Phil. 182)

102

Lamberto Torrijos v. Court of Appeals
L-40336, Oct. 24, 1975
FACTS: In 1964, Torrijos purchased a lot from Diamnuan.
Later, Torrijos learned that in 1969, Diamnuan sold the same
lot to De Guia. Torrijos initiated an estafa complaint against
the seller, who was eventually convicted by the CFI (now RTC).
During the pendency of the case in the Court of Appeals, the
accused Diamnuan died. His lawyer filed a motion to dismiss the
case alleging that the death of his client, prior to final judgment,
extinguished both the personal and the pecuniary penalties.

ISSUE: Is the civil liability also extinguished? Should the
case be dismissed?
HELD: The civil liability here is not extinguished, because
independently of the criminal case, the accused was civilly liable
to Torrijos. If after receiving the purchase price from Torrijos, he
failed to deliver the property (even before selling it again to De
Guia), there would as yet be no estafa, but there is no question of
his civil liability through an action by Torrijos either for specific
performance plus damages, or rescission plus damages. Death
is not a valid cause for the extinguishment of a civil obligation.
Had the only basis been the commission of estafa, it is clear that
the extinguishment of the criminal responsibility would also
extinguish the civil liability, provided that death comes before
final judgment.
Furthermore, under Arts. 19, 20, and 21 of the Civil Code,
the accused would be civilly liable independently of the criminal
liability for which he can be held liable. And this civil liability
exists despite death prior to final judgment of conviction.
The case, therefore, cannot as yet be dismissed.
(10) Kind of Proof Needed

If a civil action merely is instituted, mere preponderance
of evidence is sufficient.
(b) If a criminal case is brought (and with it, the civil case),
the guilt must be established by proof beyond reasonable
doubt.

(a)

103

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1161

(11) Effect of Acquittal in Criminal Case

Suppose a defendant in a criminal case is acquitted, can
he still be held liable civilly?

ANS.: It depends.
(a) If the reason why there was an acquittal was because the
accused could not have committed the act (as when he was
in another country at the time he was supposed to have
murdered somebody in the Philippines), no civil action can
later on be brought.
(b) If the reason for the acquittal was because of an exempting
circumstance (as in the case of an insane defendant), he
would still be civilly liable (if he has no guardian, or if the
guardian who may under the circumstance be ordinarily
liable, is insolvent).
(c)

If there is an independent civil action allowed by the law,
civil liability may still arise if this action is instituted and
the defendant’s liability is proved by mere preponderance
of evidence (because while guilt beyond reasonable doubt
might not have been proved, it would be a simpler matter
to prove guilt by mere preponderance of evidence).

Co San v. Director of Patents, et al.
L-10563, Feb. 23, 1961
A judgment of acquittal in a criminal action for
fraudulent registration of a trademark in violation of Sec.
18 of Act No. 666, cannot be invoked as res judicata in a
civil action based on unfair and malicious competition on
the ground that the facts of the latter are different and
have not been passed upon in the judgment rendered in
the former case. (See Ogura v. Chua and Confesor, 50 Phil.
471)

(12) Example of Independent Civil Actions

“In cases of defamation (libel, slander), fraud (estafa,
deceit), and physical injuries (including attempted, frustrated,
or consummated homicide, murder, parricides or infanticide)
a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from

Art. 1161

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the criminal action may be brought by the injured party (or
his heirs). Such civil action shall proceed independently of the
criminal prosecution, and shall require only a preponderance
of evidence.” (Art. 33, Civil Code)
(13) Effect of Reservation of the Civil Aspect

Jovencio Luansing v. People
& Court of Appeals
L-23289, Feb. 28, 1969
FACTS: In a criminal action for seduction, the offended
party expressly reserved the right to file a separate civil action.
The CFI (now RTC) found the accused guilty, and imposed
civil liabilities. No motion for reconsideration was filed by the
offended party.
ISSUE: Was the imposition of civil liability proper, despite
the reservation?
HELD: No, the imposition of the civil liability was not
proper because:
(a) there was the reservation as to the civil aspect;
(b) the mere failure to file a motion for reconsideration
does not necessarily result in waiver or abandonment.
Abandonment requires a more convincing quantum
of evidence than mere forbearance to actually file the
civil action, especially when we consider the fact that
the same could be filed even after the decision in the
criminal case had been rendered;
(c) proof should be given with respect to the amount.
(14) Is There Need of Making a Reservation of the Civil Case
(Where the Law Grants an Independent Civil Action) If a

Criminal Case Is First Brought to Court?
Under Rule 111, Secs. 1 and 3 of the New Rules on Criminal
Procedure, the answer is YES. In the case of Garcia, et al. v.
Judge Florido, L-35095, Aug. 31, 1973, the Court ruled that
while a reservation is indeed required, the reservation need
not be made at the time the criminal proceedings are filed, if
the offended parties had no chance to do so (as when they were
105

104

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1161

still in a hospital, as a result of injuries suffered in a vehicular
accident, at the time the criminal suit against the erring driver
was filed). However, in the case of Crispin Abellana, et al. v.
Judge Maraue, L-27760, May 29, 1974, the Court said that
Rule 111 of the New Rules on Criminal Procedure, insofar as it
requires a reservation even in the case of an independent civil
action, is of doubtful constitutionality inasmuch as the Rules of
Court cannot amend substantial law, like the Civil Code.
Garcia v. Florido
L-35095, Aug. 31, 1973
FACTS: After a vehicular accident, the victims were
brought to the hospital for treatment. In the meantime, the
police authorities filed a criminal case of reckless imprudence
resulting in physical injuries, WITHOUT making a reservation
as to the civil aspect. When the victims became well enough to
go to court, they decided to file a civil case despite the pendency
of the criminal case.
ISSUE: Should the civil case be allowed, despite the
pendency of the criminal proceedings?
HELD: Yes, for while it is true that a reservation should
have been made under Rule 111 of the New Rules on Criminal
Procedure (though such rule has been assailed by SOME in this
respect as virtually eliminating or amending the “substantive”
right of allowing an “independent civil action,” as ordained by
the Civil Code) still the Rule does not state when the reservation
is supposed to be made. Here the victims had no chance to make
the reservation (for they were still at the hospital); moreover, the
trial has not even begun. It is, therefore, not yet too late to make
the reservation; in fact, the actual filing of the civil case, though
at this stage, is even better than the making of the reservation.

Crispin Abellana and Francisco Abellana v.
Hon. Geronimo R. Maraue and
Geronimo Companer, et al.
L-27760, May 29, 1974
FACTS: Francisco Abellana was driving a cargo truck
when he hit a motorized pedicab. Four of the passengers of
the pedicab were injured. He was tried in the City Court of
106

Art. 1161

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ozamis for reckless imprudence (no reservation was made as
to any civil action that might be instituted); he was convicted.
He then appealed to the Court of First Instance (now Regional
Trial Court [RTC]). During the pendency of the appeal (and in
fact, before trial in the CFI [now RTC]), the victims decided to
make a WAIVER reclaim for damages in the criminal case, and
RESERVATION with respect to the civil aspects. The victims
then in another Branch of the CFI (now RTC] allowed the
FILING of the civil case. The accused objected to the allowance
on the theory that in the City Court (original court) no reservation
has been made, thus, the civil aspect should be deemed included
in the criminal suit, conformably with Rule 111 of the New Rules
on Criminal Procedure. The CFI (RTC) maintained that the civil
case should be allowed because, with the appeal, the judgment
of the City Court had become vacated (said court was then not
a court of record) and in the CFI (RTC) the case was to be tried
anew (trial de novo). This ruling of the CFI (RTC) was elevated
to the Supreme Court on certiorari.
ISSUE: May a civil case still be brought despite the appeal
in the criminal case?

HELD: Yes, for three reasons:
(a)

Firstly, with the appeal, the original judgment of conviction
was VACATED; there will be a trial de novo in the CFI
(RTC), a trial that has not even began; therefore, a
reservation can still be made and a civil action can still be

allowed.
(b)

Secondly, to say that the civil action is barred because no
reservation (pursuant to Rule 111) had been made in the
City Court when the criminal suit was filed is to present
a grave constitutional question, namely, can the Supreme
Court, in Rule 111 amend or restrict a SUBSTANTIVE
right granted by the Civil Code? This cannot be done.
The apparent literal import of the Rule cannot prevail. A
judge “is not to fall prey," as admonished by Justice Frank
Frankfurter, “to the vice of literalness.”

(c)

Thirdly, it would be UNFAIR, under the circumstances,
if the victims would not be allowed to recover any civil
liability, considering the damage done to them.

Roy Padilla v. Court of Appeals
L-39999, May 31, 1984

If a person is acquitted in a criminal case on reasonable
doubt, he may, in the very same criminal case, be held liable
for damages, if this is warranted by the evidence that had been
adduced. There is no need to institute a separate civil suit for
damages.

People v. Castafieda
GR 49781, June 24, 1983

If a person is not criminally liable, it does not necessarily
follow that he is also not civilly liable. He may indeed be civilly
responsible. Thus, he may still be sued civilly for the same act.
People v. Teresa Jalandoni
GR 57555, Aug. 28, 1984

Even if an accused in an estafa case is acquitted on
reasonable doubt she may still be held civilly liable, following

People v. Entes

the dismissal of a criminal complaint.

A quasi-delict is a fault or act of negligence (or omission
of care) which causes damages to another, there being no pre¬
existing contractual relations between the parties.
[NOTE: If a person is sued for causing damage through the
violation of traffic rules, the accusation is one actually referring
to negligence or quasi-delict or culpa aquiliana. “Violation of
traffic rules” is merely descriptive of the failure of the driver to
observe, for the protection of the interests of others, that degree
of care, precaution, and vigilance which circumstances justly
demand, which failure results in injury on claimants. Excessive

reckless imprudence.]

(5) Definitions of Negligence (Culpa)

“Negligence is the failure to observe, for the protection
of the interests of another person, that degree of care,
precaution, and vigilance which the circumstances justly
demand, whereby such other person suffers injury.” (U.S.
v. Barrias, 23 Phil. 434)
(b) As defined by the Civil Code, negligence is the omission of
that diligence which is required by the circumstances of
person, place, and time. (See Art. 1173) Thus, negligence
is a question of fact. (See Tucker v. Milan, [C-A.] 49 O.G.
4397, Oct. 1953)
(a)

Contributory negligence is conduct on the part of the
injured party, contributing as a legal cause to the harm he has
suffered, which falls below the standard to which he is required
to conform for his own protection.
(8) Requirements Before a Person Can Be Held Liable for a

Quasi-Delict
(a)

there must be fault or negligence attributable to the person
charged;

(b)

there must be damage or injury;

(c)

there must be a direct relation of cause and effect between
the fault or negligence on the one hand and the damage or
injury on the other hand (proximate cause).
[NOTE:
1)

Proximate cause is that adequate and efficient cause,
which in the natural order of events, necessarily
produces the damages or injury complained of.
In the case of Tuoson v. Luzon Stevedoring
Co., et al., L-13541, Jan. 28, 1961, the Supreme
Court held that since the plaintiff, Eduardo Tuason,
was travelling at a very high rate of speed, and on
the wrong side of the road, his negligence was the
proximate cause of the accident which badly injured
him, and therefore he cannot recover damages from
the other party in the collision.

There are instances when “although there is damages,
there is no legal injury or wrong” (damnum absque
injuria damage without legal injury). (Example: If

(6) Test for Determination of Negligence

“The test in determining whether a person is negligent

to refrain from that course, or to take precaution against

In the case of Phil. Bank of Commerce v. CA (336 Phil.
667 [1997]), while the Supreme Court found petitioner bank
as the culpable party under the doctrine of last clear chance
since it had, through its titles, the last opportunity to avert
the injury incurred by its client simply by faithfully observing
its own validation procedure, it, nevertheless, ruled that the
plaintiff depositor (private respondent) must share in the loss
on account of the contributory negligence in not checking the
monthly statements of account.

NATURE AND EFFECT OF OBLIGATIONS
Art. 1163. Every person obliged to give something is also
obliged to take care of it with the proper diligence of a good
father of a family, unless the law or the stipulation of the
parties requires another standard of care.
COMMENT:
(1) Duty to Exercise Diligence

This Article deals with the first effect of an obligation to
deliver a determinate thing (as distinguished from a generic thing
— or one of a class) namely the duty to exercise proper
diligence. Unless diligence is exercised, there is a danger that
the property would be lost or destroyed, thus rendering illusory
the obligation. (See 8 Manresa 35-36)

—

—

(2) Diligence Needed

(a)

That which is required by the nature of the obligation and
corresponds with the circumstances of person, time, and
place. (Art. 1173, Civil Code) This is really diligence of a
good father of a family.

(b)

However, if the law or contract provides for a different
standard of care, said law or stipulation must prevail. (Art.
1163, Civil Code)
[Example of a case where the law requires extraordinary care
(not merely that of a prudent man):
“A common carrier is bound to carry the passengers safely
as far as human care and foresight can provide, using the utmost
diligence of very cautious persons, with a due regard for all the
circumstances.” (Art. 1755, Civil Code)]

(3) Some Cases

Obejera, et al. v. Iga Sy
76 Phil. 580

FACTS: During the Japanese occupation, A and B sought
refuge in the house of a certain Villena in Batangas, Batangas.
When the Japanese neared the place, A and B hid their valuables
in Villena’s dugout. Later, the valuables were lost. A claimed
that he had given his things to B as a deposit, and that therefore
B should be liable for the loss. B denied the existence of such
deposit. Decide the question of liability.
HELD: In the first place, it is hard to believe that B
consented to safeguard the valuables at a time when no one
could be sure of his own life. In the second place, granting that
B had assumed the obligation to take care of the property,
still considering the circumstances of the time and place, the
obligation to return the valuables was extinguished by the loss
of the thing through something which was not the fault of B.
Bishop of Jaro v. De la Pena
26 Phil. 144

FACTS: A priest, A. de la Pena, was the custodian of
certain charity funds (P6,641) which he deposited together
with his personal account of (P19.000) in an Iloilo Bank shortly
before the American invasion of the Philippines. During the
revolution, Pena became a political prisoner and his bank deposit
was confiscated on the ground that they were being used for

destroyed several houses. Caltex and the station manager were
sued.
ISSUE: Without proof as to the cause and origin of the
fire, would the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur apply such that the
defendants can be presumed negligent?
HELD: Yes, for the gasoline station was under the care of
the defendant, who gave no explanation at all regarding the fire.
It is fair to reasonably infer that the incident happened because
of their want of care.
Ronquillo, et al. v. Singson
CA, L-22612-R, April 22, 1959

FACTS: A man ordered a ten-year-old boy, Jose Ronquillo,
to climb a high and rather slippery santol tree, with a promise
to give him part of the fruits. The boy was killed in the act of

climbing.

ISSUE: Is the person who ordered him liable?

HELD: Yes, in view of his negligent act in making the
order. He did not take due care to avoid a reasonably foreseeable
injury to the ten-year-old boy. The tree was a treacherous
one, a veritable trap. His act was clearly a departure from the
standard of conduct required of a prudent man. He should have
desisted from making the order. Since he failed to appreciate the
predictable danger and aggravated such negligence by offering
part of the fruits as a reward, it is clear that he should be made
to respond in damages for the actionable wrong committed by

him.

revolutionary purposes.

ISSUE: Is he liable for the loss of the trust funds?
HELD: No, because negligence did not exist in his
depositing the money with the bank. It is as if the money was
taken from him by force and clearly, he should not be responsible.
Bernabe Africa, et al. v. Caltex, et al.
L-12986, March 31, 1966

tank where the nozzle of the hose had been inserted. The fire

Art. 1164. The creditor has a right to the fruits of the thing
from the time the obligation to deliver it arises. However, he
shall acquire no real right over it until the same has been
delivered to him.

COMMENT:
(1) When Creditor Is Entitled to the Fruits
Example: A is obliged to give B on Dec. 3, 2004, a particular
parcel of land. (Before Dec. 3, he has no right whatsoever over
the fruits). After Dec. 3, 2004, B, the creditor is entitled (as of
115

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1164

right) to the fruits. But if the fruits and the land are actually or
constructively delivered only on Dec. 15, 2004, B becomes owner
of said fruits and land only from said date. Between Dec. 3 and
Dec. 15, B had only a personal right (enforceable against A);
after Dec. 15, he has a real right (over the properties), a right
that is enforceable against the whole world.
[NOTE: A personal right is also called jus in personam or
jus ad rem; a real right is a jus in re. (See Fidelity and Deposit
Co. v. Wilson, 8 Phil. 51) A personal right is power demandable
by one person of another to give, to do, or not to do (3 Sanchez
Roman 6, 8); a real right is a power over a specific thing (like the
right of ownership or possession) and is binding on the whole
world. (See 3 Sanchez Roman 6, 8)]
[NOTE: In the case of a purchase of land, for example,
before the land is delivered, the proper remedy of the buyer
(since he is not yet the owner) is to compel specific performance
and delivery, and not an action reinvindicatoria (for the latter
remedy presupposes ownership). (See Garchitorena v. Almeda,
[CA.] 48 O.G. 3432; see also Cruzado v. Bustos & Escaler, 34
Phil. 17)]

Rufo Quemuel v. Court of Appeals
L-22794, Jan. 16, 1968
FACTS: Rufo Quemuel was convicted by the Court of First
Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Rizal of the crime of libel.
The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. On appeal
to the Supreme Court, he alleged, among other things:
(a)

That there was no proof that damages had been sustained
by the offended party; and
119

118

Art. 1166

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

That subsidiary imprisonment for non-payment of the
indemnity constitutes imprisonment for non-payment of
debt and is therefore unconstitutional.

HELD:
As regards the alleged absence of proof that the offended
party has suffered mental anguish, loss of sleep, or could
not look at his neighbor straight in the eye, suffice it
to stress that by its very nature, libel causes dishonor,
disrepute and discredit; that the injury to the reputation of
the injured party is a natural and probable consequence of
the defamatory words in libel cases; that where the article
“the law implies damages”; and that
is libelous per se
the complainant in libel cases is “not required to introduce
evidence of actual damages,” at least, when the amount of
the award is more or less nominal.
(b) The civil Lability arising from libel is not a “debt,” within
the purview of the constitutional provision against
imprisonment for non-payment of a “debt.” Insofar as said
injunction is concerned, “debt” means an obligation to pay
a sum of money “arising from contract” express or implied.
In addition to being part of the penalty, the civil liability
in the present case arises from a tort or crime, and hence,
from law. As a consequence, the subsidiary imprisonment
for non-payment of said liability does not violate the
constitutional injunction.
(a)

—

i

[NOTE: Under a comparatively new Republic Act,
courts can no longer impose subsidiary imprisonment in
case of civil liability arising from a crime precisely on the
theory that said subsidiary imprisonment would seem
to violate the constitutional injunction. However, if fines
(not civil liabilities) are unpaid to the State (note that
civil liabilities go to offended private parties), subsidiary
imprisonment can be imposed (provided the decision of the
court imposes such subsidiary imprisonment).]
(6) Effect of Fortuitous Events

Another important difference between a generic and
a specific obligation is that, a specific obligation, that is, an
obligation to deliver a specific thing, is, as a rule, extinguished
120

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1165

by a fortuitous event or act of God. Upon the other hand, generic
obligations are never extinguished by fortuitous events.

Examples:
(a)

A is obliged to give B this car. Before delivery, an
earthquake destroys completely the car. The obligation to
deliver is extinguished.

(b)

A is obliged to give B a book. Since this is a generic thing,
even if one particular book is lost, other books may take
its place. Hence, the obligation is not extinguished (genus
nunquam perit).

(7) Two Instances Where a Fortuitous Event Does Not

Exempt

The third paragraph of Art. 1165 gives two instances when
a fortuitous event does not excuse compliance:
(a)

if the obligor “delays” (This is really default or "mora.^

(b)

if the obligor is guilty of BAD FAITH (for having promised
to deliver the same thing to two or more persons who do
not have the same interest as when one is not the agent
merely of the other)

—

[NOTA BENE: “Fortuitous events,” by definition, are
extraordinary events not foreseeable or avoidable. (Metro
Concert Steel Corp. v. Allied Bank Corp., 711 SCRA 479)]

(8) ‘Ordinary Delay* Distinguished from ‘Default’

Ordinary delay is different from legal delay (default). The
first is merely non-performance at the stipulated time; default
is that delay which amounts to a virtual nonfulfillment of the
obligation. (As a rule, to put a debtor in default, there must be
a demand for fulfillment, the demand being either judicial or
extrajudicial.)
(9) Examples
(a)

A is obliged to give B his Jaguar car on Dec. 7, 2005. If
on said day, A does not deliver, he is in ordinary delay
(not default). If on Dec. 8, 2005, an earthquake destroys
121

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1165

the Jaguar car, A is not liable because the obligation is
extinguished.
(b)

If, however, on Dec. 8, demand was made for delivery, A
would be in legal delay (default) and if later, the car is
destroyed by a fortuitous event, he would still be liable
(in that the obligation to deliver the lost specific thing is
converted into a monetary claim for damages). (See Art.
1165, Civil Code) However, if the car would have been
destroyed at any rate even if no demand had been made,
the amount of damage would be reduced. (Art. 2215, No.
4, Civil Code)

(10) Some Decided Cases and Court Rulings

The phrase “100 kilos of 1st class sugar raised in my
plantation” deals with a generic thing because of lack of physical
segregation. (Yu Tek v. Gonzales, 29 Phil. 284)

Yu Tek v. Gonzales
29 Phil. 384

FACTS: A obligated himself to sell for a definite price a
certain specified quantity of sugar of a given quality, without
designating a particular lot.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1166

HELD: A is not legally bound to pay because there was
no perfected sale yet, since the condition, namely, the proof of
ownership had, at that time of loss, not yet been fulfilled. A was
not a buyer; he was only a would-be buyer.
[NOTE: Had A already bought the ship
(had the proof
of ownership been presented earlier)
he would have been
compelled to pay the purchase price even if at the time of loss,
the thing had not yet been delivered to him, since after all, the
sale would have been already perfected.]

— —

Gutierrez Repide v. Alzeliua
39 Phil. 190

FACTS: A bought property from B on installment. When
the first installment fell due, A did not pay. His defense was that
he did not have money, and he therefore pleaded impossibility
of performance.
ISSUE: Is A excused from his obligation?
HELD: No. Mere pecuniary inability to pay does not
discharge an obligation to pay, nor does it constitute any defense
to a decree for specific performance. The stability of commercial
transactions requires that the rights of the seller be protected
just as effectively as the rights of the buyer.

ISSUE: In case the sugar is lost by a fortuitous event, who
bears the loss prior to delivery, the seller or the buyer?

Art. 1166. The obligation to give a determinate thing
includes that of delivering all its accessions and accessories,
even though they may not have been mentioned.

HELD: In this case, the seller bears the loss because what
was to be delivered was not a specific thing, but a generic thing.
And genus never perishes. Incidentally, the sale here cannot
be said to have been already perfected because of the lack of
physical segregation from the rest of the sugar.

a piece of land, I must give also the accessions (like a building
constructed thereon). (This is true even if no mention of them
was made in the contract.)

those joined to or included with the principal

the keys to a house, the dishes in a restaurant.)

include alluvium (soil gradually deposited by the current of a
river on a river bank) and whatever is built, planted, or sown
on a person’s parcel of land.

(3) Accessions

[NOTE: Even if the windows of a building have been
temporarily removed, they should still be included.]
(4) Effect of Stipulation

Of course, if there is a stipulation to said effect, accessions
and accessories do not have to be included.
Art. 1167. If a person obliged to do something fails to do
it, the same shall be executed at his cost.

This same rule shall be observed if he does it in
contravention of the tenor of the obligation. Furthermore, it
may be decreed that what has been poorly done be undone.

COMMENT:
(1) Positive Personal Obligations

The first sentence of the Article deals with a positive
personal obligation (TO DO).
(2) Remedies of Creditor If Debtor Fails to Do

(a)

(b)

To have the obligation performed (by himself or by another)
at debtor’s expense (only danother can do the performance).
(See Chavez v. Gonzales, L-27454, April 30, 1970)
Also — to obtain damages. (Art. 1170, Civil Code) (Damages
alone cannot substitute for performance if owners can do
it; if purely personal or special as a painting to be done
by a reputed artist — only damages may be asked, unless
substitution is permitted.)
[NOTE: Specific performance is not a remedy in
personal obligations; otherwise, this may amount to
involuntary servitude, which as a rule is prohibited under

—

our Constitution.]

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1167

[NOTE: A party to an agreement to marry who hacks
out cannot be held liable for the crime of slander by deed
for then that would be an indirect way of compelling said
party to go into a marriage without his or her free consent,
and this would contravene the principle in law that what
cannot be done directly should NOT be done indirectly;
and said party therefore has the right to avoid for himself
or herself the evil of going through a loveless marriage,
pursuant to Art. 11, par. 4 of the Revised Penal Code.

Chavez v. Gonzales
L-27454, April 30, 1970
FACTS: A typewriter owner delivered the same
to a repairman for repairs agreed upon orally. Despite
repeated demands, no work was done thereon. Eventually
the repairman returned the machine, unrepaired and
worse, several parts were missing, thus the description
“cannibalized and unrepaired.” The owner was then
constrained to have the typewriter repaired in another
shop. Owner now claims damages from the first repairman
(for the cost of the repairs and the cost of the missing parts).
Defendant repairman, however, alleges that owner should
have first filed a petition for the court to fix the period
within which the job of repairing was to be finished.
ISSUES:
(a)

Can the defendant be held liable for damages?

(b)

How about the failure of the owner to first ask
the court for the fixing of the period?

HELD:
(a) Yes, the defendant can be held for damages and this
would include the cost of labor and needed materials,
as well as the value of the missing parts. According
to Art. 1167 “If a person obliged to do something
fails to do it, the same shall be executed at his cost
The same rule shall be observed if he does it in
contravention of the tenor of the obligation.”

Arte. 1168-1169

(b)

The failure of the owner of the computer notebook
to first ask the court for a fixing of the period within
which the repairs were to be done is of no significance.
In view of his returning of the machine, the time for
compliance may be deemed to have already expired.
There is, therefore, no more period to be fixed,
there already being a breach of contract by non¬
performance. Said non-performance may be said to
have been impliedly admitted when the notebook was
returned unrepaired and with some of its essential
parts missing.

(3) When a Thing May Be Ordered Undone

if made poorly (Art. 1167) (Here performance by another
and damages may be demanded).
(b) if the obligation is a negative one (provided the undoing is
possible).

the obligor does what has been forbidden him, it shall also be
undone at his expense.

(3) When demand would be useless, as when the obligor
has rendered it beyond his power to perform.

In reciprocal obligations, neither party incurs in delay
if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a
proper manner with what is incumbent upon him. From the
moment one of the parties fulfills his obligation, delay by the
other begins.
COMMENT:
(1) Default or Mora

Although Art. 1169 uses the words“in delay,” these should
be translated to mean default (MORA).
(2) Necessity in General of Demand

To put a debtor in default, as a rule, DEMAND is needed.
The demand may be judicial, as when a complaint for specific
performance is filed; or extrajudicial, without court proceedings.

This Article refers to a negative personal obligation.
Asa rule, the remedy is the undoing of the prohibited thing
plus damages. (See Art. 1170, Civil Code)

(a)

When the lau> so provides. (Example: Taxes should be paid
within a definite period, otherwise penalties are imposed
without need of demand for payment.)

(b)

When the obligation expressly so provides.
[NOTE: The mere fixing of the period is not enough;
there must be a provision that if payment is not made
when due, default or liability for damages or interests
automatically arises. (See De la Rosa v. Bank of P.I., 51
Phil. 926)]

Art. 1169. Those obliged to deliver or to do something incur
in delay from the time the obligee judicially or extrajudicially
demands from them the fulfillment of their obligation.
However, the demand by the creditor shall not be
necessary in order that delay may exist:

Art 1169

Examples: The making of a wedding dress, if
the wedding is scheduled at the time the dress is due;
agricultural contracts where implements are needed at
a particular time; the selling of land with payment at
specified time, so that the seller could pay off certain debts
that were due on said date (Abella v. Francisco, 55 Phil.
447); money needed to finance mining installations if said
installations had to be made on a certain date. (Hanlon v.
Hausserman, 40 Phil. 796)
[NOTE: It is not essential for the contract to
categorically state that time is of the essence; the intent is
sufficient as long as this is implied. (Hanlon v. Hausserman,
supra)]
(d) When demand would be useless, as when the obligor has
rendered it beyond his power to perform. (Examples: When
before the maturity, the seller has disposed of it in favor of
another, or has destroyed the subject matter, or is hiding.)
(e)

When the obligor has expressly acknowledged that he really
is in default (But it should be noted that his mere asking
for extension of time is not an express acknowledgment of
the existence of default on his part). (See 3 Salvat 64)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(c)

Art. 1169

Requisites for mora solvendi:
1)

The obligation must be due, enforceable, and already
liquidated or determinate in amount. (TS, March 15,
1926)

2)
3)

There must be non-performance.
There must be a demand, unless the demand is not
required (as already discussed). (When demand is
needed, proof of it must be shown by the creditor). (8
Manresa 61)
[NOTE: A mere reminder, like “This is to remind
you that your next installment falls due on Jan. 7,
2005,” is not a demand because for all that we know,
lateness may still be tolerated by the creditor. (2
Castan 528)]

4)

The demand must be for the obligation that is due
(and not for another obligation, nor one with a bigger

amount, except in certain instances, considering all
the circumstances). (See TS, Jan. 1910)
(d)

Effects of Mora Solvendi
1)

If the debtor is in default, he may be liable for interest
or damages.

(4) Different Kinds of Mora

(a)

2)

He may also have to bear the risk of loss.
(In both cases, it is, however, essential that his being
in default is attributable to his own fault.)

3)

He is liable even for a fortuitous event (Art. 1165, Civil
Code), although damages here may be mitigated if he
can prove that even if he had not been in default, loss
would have occurred just the same. (Art. 2215, Civil

mora solvendi (default on the part of the debtor)
1)
2)

mora solvendi ex re (debtor’s default in real
obligations)
mora solvendi ex persona (debtor’s default in personal
obligations)

(b)

mora accipiendi (default on the part of the creditor)

(c)

compensatio morae (when in a reciprocal obligation both
parties are in default; here it is as if neither is in default)

(S) Mora Solvendi

There is no mora solvendi in negative obligations (one
cannot be late in not doing or giving).
(b) There is no mora in natural obligations.

(a)

128

Code)
(e)

In a purchase by installments, the contract may provide
for an “acceleration clause” (a clause which would make all
installments due, upon default in one installment). Default
in the payment of one installment does not mean default
in the whole amount. If there is an acceleration clause, all
that happens will be that the whole amount becomes due.
And demand is still needed to put the debtor in default.
(See Queblar v. Garduno & Martinez, 62 Phil. 897)
129

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1169

(6) Mora Accipiendi

(a)

(b)

If an obligation arises ex delicto (as the result of a crime),

“When the debt of a thing certain and
determinate proceeds from a criminal offense, the
debtor shall not be exempted from the payment of its
price, whatever may be the cause for the loss, unless
the thing having been offered by him to the person
who should receive it, the latter refused without
justification to accept it.” (Art. 1268, Civil Code)

(c)

2)

or keep it himself (here he should still exercise
diligence and care, but this time, he would not
be liable for loss due to a fortuitous event). (See 2
Manresa 361) (Loss through robbery with violence
is a fortuitous event provided that the violence or
intimidation was irresistible or grave.)]

The improper refusal of the lessor (creditor) to accept the
rents tendered by the lessee places said lessor in default
(mora) and he must shoulder the subsequent accidental loss
of the premises leased. The mora accipiendi of said lessor
is not cured by the lessee’s failure to make consignation of
the rejected payments, but the lessee remains obligated
to pay the amounts he had tendered but did not deposit
in court. (Vda. de Villaruel, et al. v. Manila Motor Co. and
Caloniares, L-10394, Dec. 3, 1958)
130

If the performance is not set on different dates, either
by the law, contract, or custom, it is understood that
performance must be simultaneous. Hence, one party
cannot demand performance by the other, if the former
himself cannot perform. And when neither has performed,
there is compensatio morae (default on the part of both;
so it is as if no one is in default). If one party performs,
and the other does not, the latter would be in default. (See
Gutierrez Hermanos v. Oria Hermanos, 30 Phil. 491)

Mariano Rodriguez, et al. v.
Porfirio Belgica, et al.
L-10801, Feb. 28, 1961

ANS.: He must either
consign it in court (expenses chargeable to creditor);

—

required. This is because, in the example given, different
periods for performance were given. (See 8 Manresa 63-64)]

[NOTE: What should the criminal do if the creditor
is in mora accipiendi?

1)

Reciprocal obligations depend upon each other for
performance. (Example: In a sale the buyer must PAY, and
the seller must DELIVER.)
Here performance may be set on different dates.

[Example delivery on Dec. 9, 2005; and payment on Dec.
13, 2005. To put the seller in default, demand as a rule Tnimt
be made. Delivery, upon the other hand, does not put the
buyer in default, till after demand, unless demand is not

the debtor-criminal is responsible for loss, even though
this be through a fortuitous event, unless the creditor is
in mora accipiendi. The law says:

(c)

Art. 1169

(7) Reciprocal Obligations

(a) The creditor is guilty of default when he unjustifiably
refuses to accept payment or performance at the time said
payment or performance can be done. Some justifiable
reasons for refusal to accept may be that the payor has no
legal capacity or that there is an offer to pay an obligation
other than what has been agreed upon.
(b)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

FACTS: Rodriguez and Belgica were co-owners of land
in the proportion of 86% and 14%, respectively. Belgica
owed Rodriguez P30,000. To enable Belgica to pay it, it
was mutually agreed that Rodriguez would grant authority
to Belgica to sell or mortgage within 70 days 36% of the
land, so that Belgica would be able to raise the money for
payment of the loan.
ISSUE: From what time should the 70-day period
begin to run?

'

HELD: The period commences from the time Rodriguez
grants said authority to Belgica. For this partakes of a
reciprocal obligation
the granting of the authority and
the payment of the loan. Without such authority, it was
difficult, if not impossible, for Belgica to obtain the needed
P30.000. This was because he owned only 14% of the land.

(9) Some Decided Cases

Compania General de Tabacos v. Araza
7 Phil. 455
If a debt is not paid at the stipulated period, interest (as
damages) should be charged not from the date of maturity, but
from the time the judicial action is filed, in case no extrajudicial
demand was made.
Price, Inc. v. Rilloraza, et al.
L-82053, May 25, 1955
FACTS: A tenant leased a land on the landlord’s promise
that the latter would make improvements on the property leased.
When the landlord did not make the improvements, the tenant
sued for specific performance, that is, to make the landlord do the
improvements. Three days later, the landlord sued for unlawful
detainer for non-payment of rent.
HELD: This is reciprocal obligation, and since no
improvements have yet been made, the landlord cannot demand
rents and the tenant is not yet in default, and therefore unlawful

detainer cannot prosper.
Queblar v. Garduno and Martinez
62 Phil. 879
FACTS: A debt was payable in installments. It was also
agreed that if any installment was not paid on time, the whole
debt would mature (acceleration clause). The debtor did not pay
one installment on time. After some time, because the debtor
did not pay the whole debt, the creditor brought this action.
ISSUE: From what time was the debtor in default, from
the time the installment was not paid at the stipulated date,
132

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Alt. 1169

or from the time the action was filed? (This was essential to
determine the computation of interest.)
HELD: From the time demand was made by the filing of
the action, there having been no previous extrajudicial demand.
Hence, interest as damages should begin only from that date.
Reason: It is true that there was an acceleration clause, and this
is why the creditor is now entitled to recover the whole debt. But
the contract did not say that failure to pay one installment would
put the debtor in default. Hence, demand was still essential.

Causing v. Bencer
37 Phil. 417
FACTS: Plaintiff A, acting as guardian of some minors,
agreed to sell to defendant B a parcel of land owned in common
by her and her wards on the condition that A would first obtain
judicial approval with regard to the wards’ share. B immediately
paid part of the purchase price and proceeded to occupy the
land. Although judicial approval had been obtained, A did not
execute a deed sufficient to convey the whole parcel. Instead,
she asked for the balance of the purchase price. Failing in this,
she charged B with default and now wants to rescind or cancel
the contract on the ground of non-payment.
HELD: In reciprocal obligations like this, default on the
part of one begins only from the moment the other party fulfills
what is incumbent upon him or her. Since the plaintiff Rufina
Causing has not yet executed a deed sufficient to pass the whole
estate, she is not now in a position to rescind the contract.
De la Rosa v. Bank of P.L
51 Phil. 926
Even if prizes are not distributed on the date set in the rules
of a contest, the sponsoring company is not in default till after
a demand is made, for ordinarily one does not enter a contest
just to get the prize on the date specified.

Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals
GR 59919, Nov. 25, 1986
A debtor who incurs in delay or default is liable for damages
plus interest, generally from extrajudicial or judicial demand in
the form of interest.

Art 1169

Spouses Puerto v. Court of Appeals
GR 138210, June 13, 2002
FACTS: Petitioners committed a breach of obligation in
their refusal to pay a sum of money loaned.
ISSUE: Owing to said breach, may compensatory damages
be awarded?
HELD: Yes, by way if an interest is the amount of 12%
per annum, to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or
extrajudicial demand in accordance with Art. 1169.

Such interest is not due to stipulation. Rather it is due to
the general provision of law that in obligation to pay money;
where the debtor incurs in delay, he has to pay interest by way
of damages. (See Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA, 234 SCRA
78(1994])

(10) Imposition of Interest

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas v. Santamaria
GR 139885, Jan. 13, 2003
In Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 234
SCRA 78(1994), the following guidelines have been laid down
in the imposition of interest:
1. When an obligation, not constituting a loan or
forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of
damages awarded may be imposed at the court’s discretion with
6% rate per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on
unliquidated claims or damages except when or until demand
can be established with reasonable certainty. In the event

that demand is established with reasonable certainty, interest
shall begin to run from the time claim is made judicially or
extrajudicially. (Art. 1169, Civil Code) However, when such
certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time
demand is made, interest shall begin to run only from the date
the court judgment is made (at which time, quantification of
damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).
Actual base for computation of legal interest shall, in any case,
be on amount finally adjudged.
2. When court judgment awarding a sum of money
becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether

134

Art. 1169

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the case falls under par. 1 or par. 2 above, shall be 12% per
annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim
period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to forbearance
of credit.

Since the case at bar does not involve any obligation arising
from loan or forbearance of money, then interest should be
imposed as follows:
6% per
a. On the first billing for P450,604.96
annum computed from the date of demand on Feb. 23,
1996 while an interest of 12% per annum shall be imposed
on such amount from finality of decision until payment
thereof.
b. On the second billing for P62.451.05 6% per
annum computed from date of demand on Sept. 10, 1996
while an interest of 12% per annum shall be imposed
on such amount from finality of decision until payment
thereof.
c. On the P108.610.52 for services rendered from
April 10, 1996toJuly31, 1996 6% per annum computed
from date of decision of IAC (Intermediate Appellate Court)
on Feb. 20, 1998 while interest of 12% per annum shall
be imposed on such amount from finality of decision until
payment thereof.

(11) Query

When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance
of money, is breached, may an interest on the amount of damages
awarded be imposed?

ANS.: Yes, at the discretion of the court at the rate of
6% p.a. Thus, when the judgment of the court awarding a sum
of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest,
shall be 6% p.a. from such finality until its satisfaction. (Nacar
v. Gallery Frames, 703 SCRA 439)
[NOTA BENE: In People v. Galagas, Jr., 707 SCRA 411,
the Supreme Court ruled that the amounts awarded to the victim
shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum, to earn from
the date of finality of judgment until fully paid.]

Nacar v. Gallery Frames
703 SCRA 439

ISSUES: (1) When the obligation is breached, and it
consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or
forbearance of money, what should be the interest due?; and (2)
In the absence of stipulation, what is the rate of interest, and
how shall it be computed?

[NOTE: In McConnel, et al. v. Court of Appeals,
L-10510, March 17, 1961, it was held that even
individual stockholders may be held liable for
corporate obligations wherever circumstances show
that the corporate entity is being used as an alter
ego or business conduit for the sole benefit of the
stockholders or else to defeat public convenience,
justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime. The
fiction of separate personality cannot be used to shield
fraud. In Rivera, et al. v. Colago, et al., L-12323, Feb.
24, 1961, the Court held that the government officials
concerned are duty bound to implement the provisions
of the minimum wage law by appropriating the
necessary amounts for the payment of the increased
salaries of the employees. Such appropriation cannot
be left at their discretion nor can said official avoid
compliance with their duty by invoking lack of funds.
While ordinarily there should have been a certification
of the availability of funds, this is NOT needed here,
for other employees had already been paid prior to
the commencement of this case. Since the duty is
mandatory, MANDAMUS can properly issue.]

HELD: (1) The interest due should be that which may
have been stipulated in writing; (2) Absent any stipulation, the
interest rate shall be 6% per annum to be computed from default,
i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to
the provisions load down under Art. 1169 of the Civil Code.
Art. 1170. Those who in the performance of their
obligation are guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay and those
who in any manner contravene the tenor thereof, are liable
for damages.

COMMENT:
(1) Grounds for Liability in the Performance of Obligations

for alleged non-payment of fees at the proper time. Is the
firm liable?

•

HELD: No, for after all, the adverse party had already
informed the firm of the former’s intention to cancel or
rescind the contract.
(3) Liability for Damages

When a common carrier fails to take its passengers to their
destination. (Gutierrez v. Gutierrez, 56 Phil. 177) While
overcrowding in a bus is not negligence per se, still the bus
is under a duty to exercise a high degree of care to protect
its passengers from dangers likely to arise therefrom.
Thus, if as a result of overcrowding a passenger falls, and
an attempted rescue by a fellow passenger is frustrated
because the bus driver immediately starts the vehicle, the
bus company can be held liable.

Those liable under Art. 1170 should pay damages, but
generally only if aside from the breach of contract, prejudice or
damage was caused. (Berg v. Teus, GR L-6453, Oct. 30, 1964)
r .

If a taxi passenger is intentionally killed by the driver,
an action for damages can be brought against both the
driver and the taxi company (or operator) under Art. 1759
of the Civil Code. The driver did not act within the scope
of his authority, but then a carrier (like the company)
must afford full protection. The carrier delegates to the
driver (its servant) the duty to protect the passengers with
utmost care. The company thus bears the risk of wrongful
or negligent acts of its employees since it has power to
select and remove. (Maranan v. Perez, GR L-22272, June

Bobis v. Prov. Sheriff of Camarines Norte
GR 29838, March 18, 1983
If a sheriff follows the literal terms of a writ of execution,

One who claims damages because of damage to goods
under the Bureau of Customs arrastre services should file
the claim with the Commission on Audit instead of filing
the case with the regular courts. The Bureau of Customs,
in operating the arrastre service, does so in connection
with a principal government function. As such, neither the
Bureau nor the Republic may be sued. Thus, the remedy
is with the Commission on Audit under Act 3083 and CA
327.

where the Supreme Court awarded only the amount
stated in the bill of lading — P500 instead of P6,729.50
the amount of actual damages. Klepper cannot
elude its provisions simply because they prejudice
him, and take advantage of those that are beneficial.)
Example: “No matter how negligent the carrier
may be, it will pay damages only up to P100, BUT,
if the shipper declares that the value of his goods is
more than P100, and pays a higher rate of freight, then
damages may be recovered to the extent of the value
declared.” [This is ordinarily valid since it rewards
honesty; but sometimes the amount will be increased
if the value of the goods be considerably higher than
the price declared as when silk cases worth P3,500
each were lost but the carrier only wanted to pay
P300 each because the shipper failed to declare a
value higher than P300. Here, the court said that
to give only P300 for each would be unconscionable,
considering the circumstances. (See Ysmael and Co.
v. Barretto, 51 Phil. 90) ]

(2) Stipulations Regarding Negligence (Future Negligence)

Gross negligence can never be excused in advance for this
would be contrary to public policy.
(b) Simple negligence may in certain cases be excused or
mitigated.
(c) Three usual kinds of stipulation in a bill of lading (contract
for the shipping or transporting of goods):
1) The first one exempts the carrier from all liabilities
for loss or damage occasioned by its own negligence.
(This is against public policy and is void). (See Art.
1745, Nos. 2 and 3, Civil Code)
Example of this invalid stipulation: “No matter
how negligent the carrier will be, it will not be
responsible for the damage caused.”
2) The second one limits the liability to an agreed
valuation, no matter how much damage is caused. (In
other words, no matter how much damage is caused,
the value that can be recovered is the same. This is
also VOID since a wealthy company would be able to
afford being negligent.)
Example: “No matter how negligent the carrier
will be, and regardless of the value of the goods, it
will pay damages only up to P100.” (Since this is void,
the actual damage may still be recovered.)
3) The third one limits the liability to an agreed value
UNLESS the shipper declares a higher value and pays
a higher rate of freight. (This is valid and enforceable,
as a rule.) (Freixas Co. v. Pacific Mail Steamship Co.,
42 Phil. 198; and Heacock v. Macondray and Co.,
42 Phil. 205) (See American President Lines, Ltd. v.

Phoenix Assurance Co. v.
Macondray & Co., Inc.
L-25048, May 13, 1975
FACTS: A shipper in South Carolina sent to a carrier
ship (S.S. Fernbank) for eventual delivery to Floro Spinning
Mills in Manila a shipment of one box and one carton
containing textile machinery spare parts worth $4,183.74.
The value was, however, NOT DECLARED and so the
usual charge of $46.20 was made for the freightage. In the
bill of lading was printed a stipulation to the effect that
in case of loss or damage, the carrier’s liability was fixed
only at $500, unless a higher value is declared in the bill of
lading and extra freightage paid, if required (this time the
freightage would be on a value or ad valorem basis). The
shipment was insured for $5,450 with Phoenix Assurance
Company of New York. On arrival, it was discovered that
a portion of the shipment had been damaged (to the extent
of $1,512.78). The Floro Spinning Mills sued both carrier
and insurance. The Phoenix Assurance Company paid the
145

equivalent of $1,512.78. In turn, the insurance company
asked reimbursement from the carrier. The carrier,
however, said that it was willing to answer for only $500
as stated in the bill of lading.
ISSUE: How much reimbursement must be given
$500 or $1,512.78?
HELD: Reimbursement should be for only $500 in
view of the stipulation in the bill of lading, a stipulation
sanctioned by our jurisprudence. (Heacock v. Macondray
and Co., 42 Phil. 205, etc. and Arts. 1749 and 1750, Civil
Code) Be it noted that no value higher than $500 had been
declared. (Note the $500 should be given in the conversion
rate that will exist at the time satisfaction of the judgment

faith, and since also the creditor was a British company and
therefore an enemy of the Japanese occupation forces.]

(3) Rule in Contracts of Adhesion

There is greater freedom to stipulate on negligence if the
parties are on an equal plane; not where they are obviously in
unequal positions (CONTRACTS OF ADHESION) such as in
the case of employment or transportation contracts. (See Art.
1745, Civil Code; 2 Castan 532-533) Moreover, stipulations
on negligence must be strictly construed against the party
situated in a higher or more advantageous position. (See MRR
v. Compania Transatlantica, 38 Phil. 875)

(5) Kinds of Culpa Classified According to the Source of the

Obligation

culpa contractual (contractual negligence or that which
results in a breach of a contract).
(b) culpa aquiliana (civil negligence or tort or quasi-delict).

Delgado Brothers, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, et al.
L-15654, Dec. 29, 1960

FACTS: Delgado Brothers, Inc. was the official unloader
of the cargoes shipped on the American President Lines. In
its contract with the latter, a clause reads: “We, the American
President Lines, hereby assume full responsibility and liability
for damages to cargoes, ship, or otherwise arising from the use
of the unloading crane of the Delgado Brothers, Inc. and we will
not hold said Company liable or responsible in any way thereof.”
One Richard Klepper shipped through the American President
Lines a lift van containing certain personal effects. While the
van was being unloaded by the gantry crane operated by the
Delgado Brothers, it fell on the pier, breaking the goods inside.
The shipping company was ordered to pay for the damages.

(See M. Luisa

1)

This is culpa contractual (there was a contract of
carriage between the passenger and the owner of the
taxicab company). This is true even if the passenger
had not yet paid; true also, even if he had no money
to pay; true also even if the accident occurred as the
passenger was boarding the taxi. (See Lasam v. Smith,
45 Phil. 657)

Martinez v.
Barredo)

2)

The hurt passenger may bring a civil case of culpa
contractual (for breach of the contract of carriage)
against the owner of the taxicab company, and not
against the driver, because the contract is between
the passenger and the owner, and not between the
passenger and the driver, who merely represents
the owner. Hence, properly, only the owner should
be the defendant (without prejudice to his right to
reimbursement from his driver). (Sudo v. Zamora,

O.G. 962 give the correct rule, and not Gutierrez v.
Gutierrez, 56 Phil. 177)
149

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1172

3)

If the owner can prove that he exercised due diligence
in the selection and supervision of the driver, said
owner is still responsible because of “respondeat
superior" or the master-servant rule (the negligence of
the servant is the negligence of the master). However,
this “diligence” of the owner makes him a debtor in
good faith and the damages would be mitigated. (See
Manila Railroad Co. v. Compania Transatlantica, 38
Phil. 875; Cangco v. Manila Railroad Co., 38 Phil. 769
and De Guia v. Manila Electric Co., 40 Phil. 760)
All that the passenger must prove is the existence of
the contract of carriage, and the fact that there was
a breach because he did not arrive at his destination
unhurt If the company wants to escape liability, it
is its duty to prove that the driver was really careful;
otherwise, the presumption of the driver’s negligence
remains. (See Cangco v. Manila Railroad Co., 38 Phil.
769, where a train passenger, on alighting from a
train, was hurt when he fell on sacks of watermelons
carelessly strewn about; see also 8 Manresa 71)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If the taxi contained defective parts, this is also
negligence on the part of the company. The company
cannot claim /dree majeure as an excuse here. (Lasam
v. Smith, 45 Phil. 657)

San Pedro Bus Line v. Navarro
L-6291, April 29, 1954

FACTS: A passenger on a truck was hurt, but in a
criminal case against the driver, said driver was acquitted.
The victim now sues the owner of the truck for culpa
contractual.
ISSUE: May the suit still prosper?
HELD: Yes, because the action is based on a contract.
It is sufficient for him to prove the existence of the contract
of carriage and the injuries suffered. It is not necessary
for him to prove the negligence of the driver for this is
presumed here. (Of course, if the driver can prove he was
not negligent, the company would not be liable.)

court need not make an express finding of fault or

Ambaan, et al. v. Bellosillo, et al,
CA-GR 56874-R, July 8, 1981

The injured passengers of a public
utility jeep driven by a reckless driver can
sue the owner-operators of the jeep without
the necessity of first bringing a criminal case
against said driver. The governing law in such
a case is the Civil Code which requires common
carriers to carry their passengers safely to their
destinations, with the exercise of extraordinary
diligence. Considering the negligence of the
driver, it is clear that under the master and
servant rule, the liability of the ownersoperators is not subsidiary, but direct and
immediate. Indeed, the negligence of the servant
in contractual obligations is the negligence of
the master. The master and servant rule is also
known as the doctrine of “respondeat superior.’
Under this rule, the master, to escape liability,
cannot put up the defense of a good father in the
selection and supervision of employees (except
to mitigate said liability, if this defense is duly
proved).

CULPA AQUILIANA

A pedestrian was hit by a taxi and suffered physical
injuries. The taxi driver was negligent and was responsible
for the iryury.
1)

This is culpa aquiliana, there being no previous
existing contractual relations between the pedestrian
on the one hand, and the taxi driver and the owner
of the taxicab company, upon the other hand. (See
Hernandez v. Meralco, 40 O.G. 10 S. No. 11, p. 35;
Lilius v. Manila Railroad Co., 59 Phil. 758; and
Gutierrez v. Gutierrez, 56 Phil. 177)
153

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1172
2)

3)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The injured pedestrian can bring an action based on
culpa aquiliana (tort or quasi-delict) against BOTH
the taxi driver and the owner or operator of the taxicab
company. Reason: The driver is responsible for his
negligence in making possible the injury.

Ramos v. Pepsi-Cola
L-22533, Feb. 9, 1967

FACTS: A driver of Pepsi-Cola is admittedly
negligent in a vehicular collision. Suit was brought
by the other car owner against both the driver and
Pepsi-Cola. But Pepsi-Cola was able to prove diligence
in selection (no culpa in eligiendo) and supervision
(no culpa in vigilando) of the driver.

THEREFORE, in this case of culpa aquiliana, if the

owner can prove due diligence in the selection and

supervision of his driver, he could not have been
responsible in any way for the injury. Thus, this
defense is proper for the employer, and if proved, will
exempt him from liability. (Here, the master-servant
rule does not apply.) (Bahia v. Litonjua and Leynes,
30 Phil. 424; and Hernandez v. Meralco, 40 O.G. [10
S] No. 14, p. 35)
4)

Since it is the pedestrian who alleges negligence on
the part of the defendant, it is his (the pedestrian’s)
duty to present and prove said negligence. In other
words, he will have the burden of proof. As stated by
the Supreme Court: “As a general rule, it is logical
that in case of culpa aquiliana, a suing creditor should
assume the burden of proving the existence of the
negligence, as the only fact upon which his action is
based.” ( Cangco v. Manila Railroad Co., 38 Phil. 769,

Sugar Co., Inc., et al.
L-6790, March 28, 1955
Passengers of a private automobile who brought
a criminal action against the driver of a train, and
who reserved a civil action against the train owner,
can still bring on the basis of culpa aquiliana the
civil case against the train owner, even if the driver
be acquitted in the criminal case.
[NOTE: Even without reservation, the civil case
can also prosper. This is because the train owner is
not really a defendant in the criminal case. Moreover,
see Art. 2177, Civil Code.]

ISSUE: Is Pepsi-Cola still liable?
HELD: No, otherwise it would have been Hable
solidarily with the driver. In Philippine torts, we do
not follow the doctrine of respondeat superior (where
the negligence of the servant is the negligence of
the master). Instead, we follow the rule of bonus
familias (good father of a family). The negligence of
the employer here is only presumptive; it can therefore
be rebutted, as in this case.
Vinluan v. Court of Appeals
L-21477-81, April 29, 1966

FACTS: A passenger of a bus was hurt because
of the negligence of the driver of the bus as well as
the negligence of the driver of another vehicle.
ISSUE: Who should be liable?
HELD: According to the court, four persons are
liable: the owner of the bus, the driver of the bus,
the owner of the other vehicle, and the driver of said
other vehicle and their liability is SOLIDARY
notwithstanding the fact that the liability of the bus
company is predicated on a CONTRACT, while the
liability of the owner and driver of the other vehicle
is based on a QUASI-DELICT. (Observation: The bus
driver can be excused on the basis of culpa contractual
for the contract of common carriage was not with
him, but with the bus company; nonetheless, he can
be held liable on the basis of culpa aquiliana, there
being no pre-existing contract between him and the
passenger. Note also that the owner of the other

vehicle can be excused if he can prove due diligence
in the selection and supervision of his driver, under
Art. 2180, last paragraph, unless at the time of the
collision, said owner was also in his vehicle, in which
case, notwithstanding due care in selection and
supervision, he would still be liable, if he could have,
by use of diligence prevented the misfortune. (See Art.
2184, Civil Code)

People v. Alejandro O. Tan, Jr.
CA-GR 21947-CR, July 21, 1981
If a driver on one side of the street desires to cross
the same to be on the other side, it is not sufficient
for him to put on the left signal light of the vehicle. It
is of judicial notice that many drivers in our country
today pay little heed to such a signal, particularly if
the vehicle being driven by an approaching driver is
speeding. What the driver intent on crossing should
do is to simply WAIT for the other vehicle to pass, for
after all, the other driver has the right of way. Failure
to so wait is sheer negligence.
(c)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

his liability is automatic and subsidiary. There is no
necessity of previously reserving the case against
the owner (because the owner is not a defendant
in the criminal case). After the criminal case is
terminated, the convicted driver should pay. If the
driver be insolvent, the victim can now file a civil
action against the owner to recover on the latter's
subsidiary liability. All the victim has to do is:
a)

156

To present the judgment in the criminal case,

declaring the driver guilty.
b)

CULPA CRIMINAL
A pedestrian was injured because of the recklessness
of a taxi-driver. As we have already seen, the pedestrian
can bring an action of culpa aquiliana against the driver
and the owner of the taxi company. But if the pedestrian
wants, he may bring an action for culpa criminal (physical
injuries through reckless imprudence). In the same way,
passenger may bring not only a suit for culpa contractual
but also a suit for culpa criminal (physical injuries through
reckless imprudence).

Procedure to be followed:
The injured pedestrian will file a criminal case
against the driver (not against the owner). If the
driver is found guilty, the owner will be subsidiarily
liable if the driver is insolvent. The owner will not
be allowed to present the defense of due diligence
in the selection and supervision of his employee, for

Art 1 172

To present proof of driver’s insolvency by
showing that the execution attempted by the
sheriff could not be satisfied. In the absence of
collusion between the driver and prosecuting
attorney, once the two exhibits are presented
or proved, the judge should order the owner to
pay. The owner will not be allowed to present
any defense anymore. He cannot, however, be
said to have been deprived of his day in court
because he also had his chance, namely, in the
criminal case against the driver. In said case,
he should have given his driver a good defense
counsel, because in defending the interest of the
driver, the owner would also be defending his
own interest, for his liability is automatic and
dependent on the driver’s guilt and insolvency.
This is the rule in culpa criminal. (See Maria
Luisa Martinez v. Manuel H. Barredo, et al., GR
49308; and Barredo v. Garcia, 73 Phil. 607)
[NOTE: If a passenger sues for culpa
criminal, substantially the same procedure as
the above would be followed.]

(8) Some Cases

Barredo v. Garcia and Ahnario
73 Phil. 607

FACTS: A taxi-driver of Barredo killed Garcia through
reckless driving when the driver hit the carretela where Garcia
was a passenger. The driver was found guilty in the criminal
157

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1172

case (culpa criminal). But the civil action had been reserved.

Later, the heirs of Garcia brought a civil action ( culpa aquiliana)
directly against Barredo, the owner of the taxicab company
(Malate Taxicab Company). It was proved that Barredo was
negligent for his driver had been employed by him even if he
had previously been convicted for violation of the Automobile
Law. Barredo contended, however, that the action should not
have been brought against him at once, because according to
the Revised Penal Code, he should be liable only if the driver
cannot pay, and that therefore, the civil action should have been
brought first against the driver, and then, if the driver is found
guilty and insolvent, this would not be the proper time to take
the action against him (Barredo). Decide.

HELD: Barredo is confused. It is true that in a civil
obligation arising from a crime, the employer would be only
subsidiarily liable in case the employee committed the crime in
the discharge of his duties. BUT this case is not one of the civil
liability arising from a crime, but one arising from aquasi-delict
or culpa aquiliana. And under the Civil Code provisions on torts,
an employer in a case like this is not merely subsidiarily, but
primarily liable, and therefore a case can be brought directly
against him. His defense can be due diligence in the selection
and supervision of his employees, but here, he was proved to be
negligent. Hence, he can be made to pay immediately.
Nagrania v. Muluaney, Inc.
L-8326, Oct. 24, 1955
FACTS: The driver of an employer was criminally found
guilty of damage to property, and because he was insolvent, the
employer was sued for his subsidiary civil liability. The victim
asked for Pl,300, but the employer, in his answer, admitted
liability for only P300 (or Pl,000 less).

ISSUE: If both parties asked for judgment on the pleadings,
can the employer be held liable for the whole Pl,300 which had
been adjudged as the driver’s liability?
HELD: Yes, because of his automatic subsidiary liability
once the driver is found criminally guilty and insolvent. The offer
of P300 was an implied admission of both the driver’s conviction
and insolvency. That he admitted a less amount is immaterial
for, under the law, his is a complete subsidiary liability.

Maria Luisa Martinez v. Manuel B. Barredo, et al.
GR L-49308, May 13, 1948
FACTS: On April 11, 1940, a taxicab owned by Fausto
Barredo and driven by Rosendo Digman collided with a Chevrolet
car driven by Maria Luisa Martinez. A criminal case was
instituted against the taxi driver, who pleaded guilty, and was
made to pay a fine and to indemnify Martinez. Due to Digman’s
insolvency, Martinez filed an action against Barredo to hold him
subsidiarily liable. At the trial, Martinez relied solely on:
a)

the judgment of conviction against Digman;

b)

the writ of execution issued against Digman and proof
of his insolvency.

ISSUE: Would the evidence of Martinez be sufficient to
hold Barredo civilly liable?
HELD: Yes, the judgment of conviction plus proof of
insolvency is sufficient to hold the employer subsidiarily liable;
in the absence of collusion between the driver and the victim,
the stigma of a criminal conviction surpasses in effect mere
civil liability. Common sense dictates that a finding of guilt
in a criminal case in which proof beyond reasonable doubt is
necessary, should not be nullified in a subsequent civil action
requiring only preponderance of evidence. Barredo cannot
be said to have been deprived of his day in court because the
liability really depended upon the driver’s guilt and insolvency,
the liability being automatic and subsidiary. It is high time
that employers should have their employees defended very well,
supplying them with counsel, for in defending his employees’
interest (in a criminal case), he, the employer, is automatically
defending himself. It would have been different had the case
been one of culpa aquiliana.
[NOTE: This ruling was reiterated in the case of Manalo,
et al. v. Robles Trans. Co., Inc., L-8171, Aug. 16, 1956. In said
case the Court also held that the sheriff’s return of the writ of
execution showing non-satisfaction of the judgment because of
accused’s insolvency was admissible in evidence and the sheriff
does not need to testify in court as to the fact stated in the entry
because it is an official judgment. Moreover, the civil case can be

159

brought not within only four years but within ten years because
it arises out of a final judgment.]

People v. Jesus Verano
L-15805, Feb. 28, 1961

FACTS: Dominador Paras, a passenger in a truck of the
Mindanao Bus Co., was killed when the truck driven by Jesus
Verano figured in a vehicular accident. The Bus Co. paid the
heirs of the deceased P3.000. Mrs. Paras, in her own behalf,
and on behalf of her minor children with the deceased, waived
further rights to recover damages. Verano was subsequently
charged with homicide through reckless imprudence. After
trial, the lower court found him guilty. In addition to the
sentence of imprisonment, Verano was ordered to pay the
heirs of the deceased, Paras, the sum of P5.00O with subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency. The issues are whether the
waiver in favor of the company embraces the civil liability of
the driver; whether the right to recover upon the civil liability
arising from the crime may be waived and whether such waiver
may be made in behalf of the minor heirs by their mother.

HELD:
a)

b)
c)

Art. 1172

Art. 2177 says: “Responsibility for fault
or negligence
under Art. 2176 culpa aquiliana is entirely
separate
and distinct from the civil liability arising
from negligence
under the Penal Code (ex delicto). But the plaintiff
cannot
recover twice for the same act or omission of the defendant.”

Virata v. Ochoa

L-46179,’ Jan. 31, 1978

ii

A driver’s acquittal in a criminal case is not a bar to
a civil case for damages. What is prohibited
is a double
recovery for the same negligent act.
(9) ‘Contributory

- Negligence’ - Cases

FF. Cruz & Co., Inc. v. Phil. Iron
Construction
& Marine Works, Inc.
,
838 SCRA 174
(2017)

ISSUE: Can the Court of Appeals (CA) be faulted for rely¬
ing on the Board of Marine Inquiry’s (BMI’s)
factual findings to
support its own conclusion?

The waiver in favor of the company includes the civil
liability of the driver, for in case of insolvency on the part
of the driver, the company is liable under the Revised Penal
Code. For the heirs to also recover from the driver would
be to grant them double indemnity.

HELD: No. The Supreme Court ruled that the CA cannot
be faulted because such findings are supported by
substantial
evidence.

Under the Rules of Court, civil liability, whether arising
from a crime or not, can be waived.

(2017)

The waiver by Mrs. Paras in her own behalf is valid, but
not that in behalf of her minor children, since although
she is the administrator of their property, the waiver or
compromise should have had court approval, being an act
of ownership and not mere administration. (Arts. 320,
2032, Civil Code and Visayan v. Suguitan, L-8300, Nov.
18, 1955) Therefore, since P3.000 had already been paid,
the heirs may still recover P2.000, the part that had NOT
been validly waived. In other words, the indemnity in the
criminal case was reduced to P2,000.

Dela Cruz v. Octaviano
833 SCRA 238

Contributory negligence is conduct on the part of the in¬
jured party, contributing as a legal cause to the

harm he has
suffered, which falls below the standard to which he is required
to conform for his own protection.
(10) Effects of Victim’s Own Negligence

tory Negligence

(a)

and of His Contribu¬

When a plaintiffs own negligence was the immediate and
proximate cause of his injury, he cannot recover damages
(because there is no culpa aquiliana
on the part of the
defendant). (Art. 2179, Civil Code) Example: A pedestrian,
161

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1172

not looking where he was going, bumped into a carefully
driven car. He cannot recover damages in culpa aquiliana.
As a matter of fact, if any damage was caused the car, the
owner can recover from the pedestrian.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the accident was a defect in the track, a depression therein.
Previously the depression had been noticed, but the repair
upon it was done negligently. There is no question therefore
of the Company’s negligence. But the Company countered
by saying that Rakes himself was negligent in two respects:
1) Although he noticed the depression, he still continued
with his work;
2) Instead of walking in front or behind the car, Rakes
walked at the side.
The Court dismissed the first ground by saying that
Rakes did not know that the track has been repaired
negligently. The second ground, however, was admitted
to show Rakes’ negligence.

Ong v. Metropolitan Water District
L-7664, Aug. 29, 1968

FACTS: A visitor was drowned in a swimming resort
due to his own negligence, and despite measures on the
part of the resort authorities to save him.
ISSUE: Is the resort liable?
HELD: No, the resort is NOT liable. While it is duty¬
bound to provide for safety measures, still it is not an
absolute insurer of the safety of its customers or visitors.
The doctrine of “last clear chance” cannot apply if the:
1)
negligence of the plaintiff is concurrent with the
negligence of the defendant;
2)
party charged is required to act instantaneously;
3)
injury cannot be avoided despite the application at
all times of all the means to avoid the injury (after
the peril is, or should have been, discovered), at least
in all instances where the previous negligence of the
party charged cannot be said to have contributed to
the injury at all.
(b) If the plaintiffs negligence was only CONTRIBUTORY,
the immediate and proximate cause of the injury being
the defendant’s lack of due care, the plaintiff may recover
damages, BUT the courts shall mitigate the damages to
be awarded. (Art. 2179, Civil Code)

Rakes v. Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co.
7 Phil. 359
FACTS: Rakes, a Negro, was at work transporting
iron rails from a barge in the harbor to the yard of the
Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Company. At a certain spot, the
railroad track broke, upset the cart, and hit Rakes. His leg
was afterwards amputated. It was proved that the cause of
162

Art. 1172

'

ISSUE: Is this negligence of Rakes sufficient to bar
him from a recovery of damages?

HELD: No, this negligence of Rakes did not bar him
from recovering damages. Rakes did not contribute to
the accident; he only contributed to the injury or damage
upon himself. Therefore, he can still recover, but the
damages should be reduced or mitigated because of his
own contributory negligence.

,

(11) Some Doctrines
(a)

If an employer company fails to warn an ignorant employee
to be careful about an unfamiliar machine, it should
respond for damages in case of injury. (Tamayo v. Gsell,
35 Phil. 953)
(b) The mere fact that a man was drunk at the time of an
accident does not mean he was negligent, provided he
exercised due care. (Wright v. Manila Electric Co., 28 Phil.
122)

(c)

Storing potatoes in a very tight and unventilated lorcher
under a burning sun causing them to rot is gross negligence.
(Hashim and Co. v. Rocha and Co., 18 Phil. 315)
(d) Abandoning a towed vessel in a calm sea just because the
tow line broke, and with full knowledge that it might get
163

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

lost, is negligence. (Guzman v. X and Behn and Meyer &

Co. v. Phil. Motors Corp., 55 Phil. 129)
(e) If a streetcar passenger is hurt because of an accident where
there was no negligence at all, the streetcar company cannot
be liable for culpa contractual for there was no negligence.
(Carlos Goco v. Meralco, 37 O.G. p. 2275) A tire blow-out
does not constitute negligence unless the tire was already
old and should not have been used at all. Indeed, this would
be a clear case of a fortuitous event. (Rodriguez v. Red Line
Transportation Co., [CA.] 51 O.G. 3006, June 1955)
(f) Negligence is a question depending upon the facts of each
particular case; indeed it is a question of fact. (Tucker v.
Milan, [CA.] 49 O.G. 4379)
(12) Liability for the Culpa Aquiliana of Others
(a) The father and, in case pf his death or incapacity, the
mother, are responsible for the damages caused by the
minor children who live in their company, unless the
parent can prove that he or she observed all the diligence
of a good father of a family to prevent damage. (Art. 2180,
Civil Code)

Guardians are liable for damages caused by the minors or
incapacitated persons who are under their authority and
live in their company, unless said guardians observed all
the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage.
(Art. 2180, Civil Code)
(c) Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their
employees and household helpers acting within the scope of
their assigned task, even though the former are not engaged

prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father
of a family to prevent damage. (Art. 2180, Civil Code)

(2017)

FACTS: The posting of the number combination on the
safety vault’s door had not been at the instance of the petitioner,
a government official having custody of the public funds.
ISSUE: Can she be exonerated from liability considering
the factual circumstances?
HELD: Said the Supreme Court, thus [a]ltho [petitioner] could be exonerated from liability
in cases of theft and loss caused by force majeure, she
must be able to establish that the loss was not by reason
of her negligence.

“(njegligence is the omission to do something that

ISSUE: Is this ruling correct?
HELD: According to the Supreme Court

[NOTE: The classification above has not been followed
in the Civil Code because today there are very many kinds
or degrees of diligence required.]

-

[it] finds no reason to hold petitioner liable for the
charge of [d]ishonesty and [g]rave [m]isconduct.

an error of judgment and for no ulterior motives and/or
purpose, as in the present case, is merely [s]imple [n]egli-

gence.”

If slight diligence is required, it is only grave
negligence that will make the debtor liable.
If ordinary diligence is required, it is ordinary
negligence that will make the debtor liable.
If great diligence is required, even slight negligence
will make the debtor liable.]

(2) Kinds of Diligence under the Civil Code

Under the Code, the following kinds of diligence are
required:
(a)

that agreed upon by the parties
(b) in the absence of (a), that required by the law (particular
provision)

Art. 1173. The fault or negligence of the obligor consists in
the omission of that diligence which is required by the nature
of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances
of the person, of the time and of the place. When negligence
shows bad faith, the provisions of Articles 1171 and 2201,
paragraph 2, shall apply.

If the law or contract does not state the diligence which
is to be observed in the performance, that which is expected
of a good father of a family shall be required.

COMMENT:
(1) Degrees of Culpa under Roman Law

Art. 1173 changes the degrees of culpa known under Roman
Law, which were as follows:

grave negligence

[NOTE: The responsibility of a common carrier is

EXTRAORDINARY and lasts from the time the goods are
placed in its possession until they are delivered actually
or constructively, to the consignee or to the person who
has a right to receive them. (Art. 1736, Civil Code) It can
only be exempt therefrom for causes enumerated in Art.
1734. (American Pres. Lines v. Richard A. Klepper, et al.,

[NOTE: In a contract with a common carrier for
passengers (like a taxi or a jitney) the law provides that
the carrier is bound to carry the passengers safely as far
as human care and foresight can provide, using the utmost
diligence of very cautious persons, with a due regard for all
the circumstances. (Art. 1755, Civil Code) This is so even if
the passenger is carried free or at a reduced rate. (Art. 1758,

the diligence of a good father of a family to avoid injury to
himself. (Art. 1761, id.) But the contributory negligence of
the passenger does not bar recovery of damages for his death
or injuries, if the proximate cause thereof is the negligence
of the common carrier, but the amount of damages shall
be equitably reduced. (Art. 1762, id.)]

[NOTE: The Public Service Commission may, on its
own motion or on petition of any interested party, after due
hearing, cancel the certificate of public convenience granted
to any common carrier that repeatedly fails to comply with

Art. 1173

Far East Bank and Trust Co. v. Estrella O. Querimit
GR 148582, Jan. 16, 2002
FACTS: Respondents filed a complaint against petitioner¬
bank and certain officials of the latter, alleging that that they
refused to allow her to withdraw her time deposit evidenced by
four certificates of deposit in the total amount of $60,000. The
trial court ordered petitioner-bank and its officials to allow
respondent to withdraw her time deposit plus accrued interests.
The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision of the trial court
with the modification that petitioner-bank was solely liable
because the latter had a personality separate from its officers
and stockholders. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the

CA.

HELD: Petitioner-bank failed to prove that it had already
made payment considering that the subject certificates of deposit
were still in the possession of the depositors. The principle
that payment, in order to discharge a debt, must be made to
someone authorized to receive it is applicable to the payment
of certificates of deposit. Petitioner should, thus, not have paid
respondent’s husband or any third party the amount of the time
deposit without requiring the surrender of the certificates of
deposit. Laches would also not defeat respondent’s claim as she
did not withdraw her deposit because she relied on petitioner
bank’s assurance that interest would accumulate annually evenafter maturity of the time deposit and she set aside the money
therein for her retirement.
(3) Meaning of a ‘Contract of Carriage’

A contract of carriage is defined as one whereby a certain
person or association of persons obligate themselves to transport:

a fixed price. (Cathay Pacific Airways v. Reyes, 699 SCRA 725)

(4) ‘Negligence’ Defined

Art. 1174

(8) ‘Extraordinary Diligence’

The term “negligence” is the failure to observe for the
protection of the interests of another person, that degree of
care, precaution, and vigilance, which the circumstances justly
demand whereby such other person suffers injury. (St. Martin
Polyclinic Inc. v. LWV Construction Corp., 847 SCRA 378 [2017])
[NOTA BENE: As early as the case of Picart v. Smith (37
Phil. 809 [1918]), the Supreme Court elucidated that “the test
by which to determine the existence of negligence in a particular
case is: Did the defendant in doing the alleged negligent act use
that reasonable care and caution which an ordinarily prudent
person would have used in the same situation? If not, then he
is guilty of negligence.”]

(2017)

It is beyond dispute that the cause of Ed Christian’s fall is
traceable to the negligent act of Mary Ann of leaving him in the
“hands” of Lomibao who was wearing the Birdie mascot suit.
(6) Query

Does wrong without damage, or damage without wrong,
constitute a cause of action?
ANS: No, since damages are merely part of the remedy
allowed for the injury caused by a breach or wrong. (Latonio v.

689 SCRA 270

Gross inexcusable negligence is negligence characterized
by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a
situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but
willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to
consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.

'

(2017)

The diligence required of the Criminal Investigation and
Detention Group (CIDG) was extraordinary.
(9) ‘Simple Neglect of Duty*

Baguio v. Lacuna
827 SCRA 195
(2017)

FACTS: Account stenographer failed to timely transcribe
the stenographic notes as found by the Executive Judge.
i

ISSUE: Did such failure constitute “simple neglect of duty”?
HELD-. Yes. Simple neglect of duty means a disregard of,
or a failure to give proper attention to a task expected of an
employee. Moreso, it signifies carelessness or indifference.

(10) ‘Notorious Negligence’ Defined

In Manlow Navigation Phils., Inc. v. Heirs of Ricardo S.
Ganal (827 SCRA 72 [2017]), the phrase “notorious negligence*
has been defined as

-

“something more than mere or simple negligence or
contributory negligence. It signifies a deliberate act of the
employee to disregard his own personal safety.”

Art. 1174. Except in cases expressly specified by the law,
or when it is otherwise declared by stipulation or when the
nature of the obligation requires the assumption of risk, no
person shall be responsible for those events which could not
be foreseen, or which though foreseen, were inevitable.

COMMENT:

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

—

(2) Exceptions The debtor is responsible for a fortuitous event
in the following cases:
(a) When expressly declared by the law [such as when the
possessor is in BAD faith (Art. 552, Civil Code) or is in
default. (Art. 1165, Civil Code)]
(b)

(c)

When expressly declared by stipulation or contract (such
as when the contract says:
“If there be a fortuitous event that would cause
delay in the delivery of padlocks, an extension must
be sought, otherwise, damages can be asked.” (See
Republic of the Philippines v. Litton & Co., GR L-5018,
Nov. 28, 1953)]
When the nature of the obligation requires the assumption
of risk (the doctrine of CREATED RISK) [Example: When
a carrier transports dynamite, and because of an accidental
tire blow-out it injures nearby property, the carrier would
be responsible. This is because of the nature of carrying
dynamite. Upon the other hand, iiyuries caused by a tire
blow-out of a perfectly new tire, or at least a still good
one, when no explosives or dangerous things were being
carried, are due to an unavoidable accident, and the owner
of the car would not be liable. (See Rodriguez v. Red Line
Transportation Co., [C.A.] 51 O.G. 3006, June 1955)]

(3) Equivalent Terms for Fortuitous Event
(a) caso fortuito (literal translation)
(b)

act of God (like lightning)

Juan F. Nakpil and Sons, et al. v.
Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 47851, Oct. 3, 1986
To exempt the obligor from liability for a breach of
an obligation due to an “act of God," the following must
concur: (a) the cause of the breach of the obligation must
be independent of the will of the debtor, (b) the event must
be either unforeseeable or unavoidable; (c) the event must
be such as to render it impossible for the debtor to fulfill his
obligation in a normal manner; and (d) the debtor must be
free from any participation in, or aggravation of, the injury
to the creditor.
172

Art, 1174

An act of God is an accident, due directly and
exclusively to natural causes without human intervention,
which by no amount of foresight, pains or care, reasonably
to have been expected, could have been prevented.
(c)

force majeure (like war or armed robbery) but if the war
had already broken out before the contract was entered
into, the war cannot be considered unforeseen. (Server v.
Eisemberg and Co., L-10741, March 29, 1951)

(d)

unavoidable accident (like a tire blow-out provided there
was no negligence)

(4) Essential Characteristics of a Fortuitous Event
(a)

the cause must be independent of the will of the debtor
(freedom from PARTICIPATION or AGGRAVATION);

Example: Loss of a firearm which fell to the bottom of
the sea when the ship sank during a storm. (Insular Gov’t,
v. Bingham, 13 Phil. 558)
(b)

impossibility of foreseeing or impossibility of avoiding it,
even if foreseen;

Example: Damage to train passengers when the train
is hit by lightning.
(c)

the occurrence must be such as to render it impossible for
the debtor to fulfill his obligation in a normal manner.
Examples: Armed robbery causing the loss of a specific
radio, but not if money is taken for money is a generic thing;
seizure by the Japanese military forces, during the war, of
copra deposited in a warehouse. (North Negros Sugar Co.
v. Co. Gen. de Tabacos, L-9277, March 29, 1957)

(5) Some Cases

Lasam v. Smith
45 Phil. 657

FACTS: A passenger was hurt when the car he was
riding on figured in an “accident" caused either by the driver’s
recklessness or car defects.
173

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1174

HELD- The operator is liable since this is not a case of
fortuitous event. (This ruling was reiterated in the case of Jose
Son v. Cebu Autobus Co., L-6155, April 30, 1954, where the
defect was in the drag-link spring.)

Republic of the Philippines v. Litton and Co.
94 Phil. 52

FACTS: The defendant promised to deliver to the plaintiff
(government) on or before March 1, 1946, 96,000 padlocks for
election purposes but was not able to deliver two-thirds because
of certain unforeseen events (such as the vessel being stranded
at a certain island or transportation detour). In the contract, the
following provision was made: “Should there be delay in delivery,
due to a condition clearly beyond the contractor’s control, the
Purchasing Agent may grant a reasonable time for extension if
applied for before default is incurred. Deliveries made within the
extended period shall not be subject to penalties.” Although there
apparently were unavoidable causes preventing delivery on time,
contractor failed to properly ask for the needed extension.

ISSUE: Is he liable?
HELD: Yes, the contractor is liable, because properly
interpreted, the provision quoted above is one that clearly
imposes liability even for fortuitous events. Such a stipulation
is clearly allowed by the law.
Victorias Planters Assn., et al. v.
Victorias Milling Co., Inc.
97 Phil. 318
FACTS: In a contract, it was agreed that for 30 years,
the planters would deliver their sugar to a milling company.
However, during the war (four years) and during the period of
reconstitution (two years), the milling company could not operate
its mill.

ISSUE: Should the period of six years be made up? In other
words, should the planters be required to deliver for six more
years their sugar to the same mill to make up for what had been
lost?

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1174

HELD: No more, because war is a fortuitous event that
would relieve the planters from this obligation since fulfillment
then had been rendered impossible.
Crane Sy Pauco v. Gonzaga
10 Phil. 646

FACTS: Pending the decision of a case against him, the
carabaos of L were attached by a sheriff. L gave a bond for
their release, the condition being that if L loses the case, L
would deliver the animals. L lost, but was not able to deliver
the carabaos, because they had died due to cause not imputable
toL.
ISSUE: Are the bondsmen liable?
HELD: No, the bondsmen are not liable because the death
of the carabaos was fortuitous. Thus, the obligation to deliver
the carabaos was extinguished.
QUESTION: But is it not true that the bondsmen (who
had executed the bond) were precisely supposed to answer in
case of non-delivery?

ANS.: Yes, they were precisely supposed to answer but only
ifL were to deliberately withhold delivery. Here.L, was excused
from returning (the principal obligation); hence, the guaranty
(the second obligation) is automatically extinguished, since the
contract did not provide for liability even in case of force majeure.
Bailey v. Le Crespigny
Law Reports, 40 B 180

FACTS: A enters into a contract with B obligating himself
under a bond to construct a dwelling house upon a particular
tract of land. But before completion of the construction, the
government expropriated the land; hence, fulfillment was not
made.

ISSUE.- Is A liable?
HELD: No, for this was unforeseen. To decide contractwise
would be nauseating to the very idea of justice.

Nakpil and Sons v. Court of Appeals
GR 47851, Oct. 3, 1986

If a fire fortuitously breaks out and surrounding houses
are destroyed because of their nearness, lack of water, and an
unfortunate high breeze, no one can be held responsible.

FACTS: The building contractor and the architect made
substantial deviations from the plans and specifications and
failed to observe the requisite workmanship in the construction
as well as to exercise the requisite degree of supervision; while
the plans and specifications prepared by the architects contained
inadequacies and defects. 7116 defects in the construction and
in the plans and specifications were the proximate causes that
rendered the building unable to withstand the earthquake.

L-7917, April 29, 1955

in B's favor. But a fortuitous event happened. Later, A and B
agreed that because of what had happened, A would be given a
new period. But when the period arrived, A was still not able to

HELD: The contractor and the architect cannot claim
exemption from liability. The wanton negligence of both the
building contractor and the architect in effecting the plans,
designs, specifications, and construction of the building is such
negligence as to amount to bad faith in the performance of
their respective tasks. One who negligently creates a dangerous
condition cannot escape liability for the natural and probable
consequences thereof, although the act of a third person, or an act
of God for which he is not responsible, intervenes to precipitate
the loss.

ISSUE: Can A plead fortuitous event as a defense?
HELD: No more, because the settlement was made APTER,
and not before, the fortuitous event, implying a waiver of any
defense on this ground which he could have raised before.

Tan Chiong Sian v. Inchausti & Co.
22 Phil. 152
If a ship owner, knowing the dangerous and weak condition
of his vessel, nevertheless orders his captain to embark on a
voyage, and during said voyage a typhoon causes the destruction
of both the ship and its cargo, the owner will still be held liable.
He cannot absolve himself by crying “an act of God.”

Gatchalian v. Delim
GR 56487, Oct 21, 1991

To exempt a common carrier from liability for death or
physical injuries to passengers upon the ground of force majeure,
the carrier must clearly show not only that the efficient cause
of the casualty was entirely independent of the human will, but
also that it was impossible to avoid. Any participation by the
common carrier in the occurrence of the injury will defeat the
defense of force majeure. Where fortuitous event or force majeure
is the immediate and proximate cause of the loss, the obligor
is exempt from liability for non-performance. The partidas, the
antecedent of Art. 1174 of the Civil Code, defines“caso fortuito’
as an event that takes place by accident and could not have been
foreseen. Examples of this are destruction of houses, unexpected
fire, shipwreck, violence of robbers.

In a legal sense and consequently, also in relation to
contracts, a caso fortuito presents the following essential
characteristics: (1) the cause of the unforeseen and unexpected
177

Art. 1174

occurrence or the failure of the debtor to comply with his
obligation, must be independent of the human will; (2) it must
be impossible to foresee the event which constitutes the caso
fortuito, or if it can be foreseen, it must be impossible to avoid;
(3) the occurrence must be such as to render it impossible for the
debtor to fulfill his obligation in a normal manner; and (4) the
obligor must be free from any participation in the aggravation
of the injury resulting to the creditor.

Roberto C. Sicam, et al. v. Lulu V. Jorge, et al.

FACTS: Under Sec. 17 of Central Bank Circular 374,
Rules and Regulations for Pawnshops, which took effect on
July 13, 1973, and which was issued pursuant to PD 114, the
Pawnmakers Regulation Act, it is provided that pawns pledged
must be insured. However, this Section was subsequently
amended by CB Circular 764, which took effect on Oct. 1, 1980.
According to Sec. 13 thereof, office building/premises and pawns
and where the
of a pawnshop must be insured against him
requirement that insurance against burglary was deleted.
Obviously, the Central Bank (now Bangko Sentral) considered
it not feasible to require issuance of pawned articles against
burglary. In the case at bar, a robbery in a pawnshop happened
in 1987.

—

ISSUE: Considering the abovecited amendment, is there
a statute duly-imposed on petitioner to insure the pawned
jewelry in which case it was error for the Court of Appeals (CA)
to consider it as a factor in concluding that petitioners were
negligent?
HELD: There is none. Nevertheless, the preponderance of
evidence shows that petitioners failed to exercise the diligence
required of them under the New Civil Code. The diligence with
which the law requires the individual at all times to govern his
conduct varies with the nature of the situation in which he is
placed and Receipts Law. (Pilipinas Bank v. Ong, 435 Phil. 732

(6) Loss in a Shipwreck

As a general rule, the loss of the ship due to a fortuitous
event should be borne by its owner; the loss of the cargo, by their
owners, unless the captain lacked skill, or there was malice or
negligence. (Tan Chiong Sian v. Inchausti & Co., supra)
(1) Loss Because of an Act of Government

In Sabelino v. RFC, L-11790, Sept. 30, 1958, it was held
that the RFC and the PNB could be forced to accept 30-year term
backpay certificates in payment of mortgage obligations despite
the fact that acceptance thereof would freeze a large part of their
assets and compel them to sustain losses and reduction in yield.
The acceptance must be allowed because it is so provided under
RA 897. This law is an act of sovereign power and, therefore,
whatever loss incurred can be attributed to & force majeure, and
certainly the State cannot complain of a loss caused by itself.
(8) Combination of Fortuitous Event and Negligence

Suppose there is a combination of a fortuitous event and
negligence on the part of the debtor, is the obligation to deliver
a specific thing extinguished?

ANS.: It depends:
(a)

If the fortuitous event was the proximate cause, the
obligation is extinguished.

(b)

If the negligence was the proximate cause, the obligation is
not extinguished. (It is converted into a monetary obligation
for damages.)

(9) MCQ

The following cannot be considered as a fortuitous event:

A. War and labor unrest.
B. Declaration of Martial Law.

C. Earthquake and tsunamis.
D. Other Acts of God and nature.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1176

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(10) Meaning of Tortuitous Events’

"Fortuitous events” by definition, are extraordinary events
not foreseeable or avoidable. (Metro Comcast Steel Corp. v. Allied

Bank Corp., 711 SCRA 479)

(11) Meaning of the Doctrine of Assumption of Risk

Abrogar v. Cosmos Bottling Co., Inc.
820 SCRA 301
(2017)

The doctrine of assumption of risk means that one who vol¬
untarily exposes himself to an obvious, known and appreciated
danger assumes the risk of injury that may result therefrom.
Art. 1175. Usurious transactions shall be governed by
special laws.

COMMENT:

Art 1176

I will now be responsible for interest (by way of damages)
at the rate of 6% per annum, to be counted from default.
(3) Regard of People for Usury

Usury has been regarded with abhorrence from the earliest
times. (Tolentino and Manio v. Gonzales Sy Chiam, supra) It was
prohibited by the ancient laws of the Chinese and Hindus, the
Koreans, the Athenians, and the Romans. (U.S. v. Constantino,
39 Phil. 554) HOWEVER, today the Usury Law has been
REPEALED by Central Bank (now Bangko Sentral) Circular
905, effective Jan. 1, 1983.
(4) Definition of Simple Loan (Mutuum)

By the contract of simple loan, one of the parties delivers
to another money or other consumable things upon the condition
that the same amount of the same kind and quality shall be
paid. (Art. 1933, Civil Code)
(5) Lawful and Legal Rates

(1) ‘Usury’ Defined

It is contracting for or receiving something in excess of
the amount allowed by law for the loan or use of money, goods,
chattels, or credits. (Tolentino and Manio v. Gonzales Sy Chiam,
50 Phil. 558) In other words, usury is the exaction of excessive
interest.
(2) Kinds of Interest

There are two kinds of interest:
(a) Interest given for compensation or use of the money (also
called by some authors as MORATORY INTEREST).
Example: I borrowed Pl million at 8% interest
per annum for three years. (This is the kind of interest
regulated by the Usury Law.)
(b) Interest given by way of damages (also referred to by
some authors as COMPENSATORY INTEREST, i.e., it
compensates the damage caused).
Example: I borrowed Pl million with no interest for
three years. If I pay at the end of three years, I pay n0
interest. If I incur default (do not pay even after demand),

Monetary Board and by the Bangko Sentral.]

agreed upon if the loan mentions interest but no rate was
stipulated)
This used to be 6% per annum. (Art. 2209, Civil Code;
see Sec. 1, Act 2655) It is now 12% per annum as directed
by a Central Bank (Bangko Sentral) Circular.
[NOTE: No interest (by way of compensation for its
use) will be given in case it is not expressly stipulated in
writing. (Art. 1954, Civil Code)]

(6) Important Distinction between Secured (Sec. 2) and
Unsecured (Sec. 3) Loans Under the Old Usury Law

—

Section 2 penalizes the taking or receiving of excessive
interest (not the mere agreeing).

also the demanding or the agreeing to charge an excessive

who is guilty.) (See People v. Bernate, 36 O.G., p. 2720)

Yet, in Art. 1961, the law says the Civil Code prevails
“Usurious contracts shall be governed by the Usury Law
and other special laws so far as they are not inconsistent
with this Code.”
[NOTE: Either of the two conflicting articles must be

repealed.]
(NOTE: In the case of Cherie Palileo v. Beatriz Cosio,
L-7667, Nov. 28, 1955, the Supreme Court applied the Civil
Code instead of the Usury Law. However, the decision did
not discuss the conflict.]
(NOTE: In the case, however, of Angel Jose Warehousing
Co., Inc. v. Chelda Enterprises and David Syjuico, L-25704,
April 24, 1968, the Court held that with respect to the question
“how much interest can be recovered by a debtor who has
paid usurious interest?” — the interest recoverable is the entire
interest agreed upon for such entire interest is VOID. The Court
further held that with respect to said question, there is NO
CONFLICT between the Civil Code and the Usury Law.]

Angel Jose Warehousing Co., Inc. v.
Chelda Enterprises and David Syjuico
L-25704, April 24, 1988

FACTS: A partnership (Chelda Enterprises and David
Syjuico) borrowed P20.000 from Angel Jose Warehousing Co.
at clearly usurious rates (from 2% to 2 1/2% PER MONTH).
ISSUES:

Can creditor recover the PRINCIPAL debt?
(b) If the entire usurious rate has been paid by the debtor,
how much of it can be recovered by said debtor from the
creditor?

(7) Inconsistency in the Code

In case of conflict, which should prevail, the Civil Code or

(a) In Art. 1175, it is evident that the Usury Law prevails
“Usurious transactions shall be governed by special laws.

Art. 1175

HELD:
(a)

Yes, the creditor can recover the PRINCIPAL debt. The
contract of loan with usurious interest is valid as to the
for the
loan, and void only with respect to the interest
loan is the principal contract while the interest is merely

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1175

an accessory element. The two are separable from each
other. (See Lopez v. El Hogar Filipino, 47 Phil. 249) The
ruling on this point by the Court of Appeals in the case of
Sebastian v. Bautista, 58 O.G. No. 15, p. 3146, holding that
even the loan itself is void is WRONG.
(b)

With respect to the usurious interest, the entire interest
agreed upon is void, and if already paid, may be recovered
by the debtor. It is wrong to say that the debtor can recover
for
only the excess of 12% or 14%, as the case may be
the simple reason that the entire interest stipulation is
indivisible, and being illegal, should be considered entirely
void. It is true that Art. 1413 of the Civil Code states that
“interest paid in excess of the interest allowed by the
Usury Law may be recovered by the debtor with interest
thereon from the date of payment.” But, as we construe
it, Art. 1413, in speaking of “interest paid in excess of
the interest allowed by the usury laws” means the whole
usurious interest: that is, in a loan of Pl,000, with interest
of 20% per annum or P200 for one year, if the borrower
pays said P200, the whole P200 is the usurious interest not
just that part thereof in excess of the interest allowed by
law. It is in this case that the law does not allow division.
The whole stipulation as to interest is void since payment
of said interest is the cause or object, and said interest is
illegal. Note that there is no conflict on this point between
the New Civil Code and the Usuiy Law which states in
Sec. 6, that any person who for a loan shall have paid a
higher rate or greater sum or value that is allowed in said
law, may recover the whole interest paid. The only change
effected, therefore, by Art. 1413 of the New Civil Code is
not to provide for the recovery of interest paid in excess
of that allowed by law, which the Usury Law already
provided for, but to add that the same can be recovered
“with interest thereon from the date of payment." The
foregoing interpretation is reached with the philosophy
of usury legislation in mind: to discourage stipulations on
usurious interest, said stipulations are treated as wholly
void, so that the loan becomes one without stipulations as to
payment of interest. It should not, however, be interpreted
to mean forfeiture even of the principal, for this would

—

184

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1175

unjustly enrich the borrower at the expense of the lender.
Furthermore, penal sanctions are available against a
usurious lender, as a further deterrent to usury.

The principal debt remaining without stipulation
for payment of interest can thus be recovered by judicial
action. And in case of such demand and the debtor incurs
in delay, the debt earns interest from the date of the
demand, whether judicial or extrey udicial (in the instant
case, from the filing of the complaint). Such interest is not
due to stipulation, for there was none, the same being void.
Rather, it is due to the general provision of law that in
obligation to pay money, where the debtor incurs in delay,
he has to pay interest by way of damages. (Art. 2209, Civil
Code)

Liam Law v. Olympic Sawmill
L-30771, May 28, 1984
1.

The requirement in the Usury Law and the Rules of
Court that an allegation of usury, if it is denied, must
be denied under oath, applies only if it is the plaintiff
making the allegation, not the defendant.

2.

Under Central Bank (now Bangko Sentral) Circular
905, usury had been abolished in our country since
Jan. 1, 1983. Interest will now depend on the mutual
agreement of borrower and lender.

3.

The provisions on usury allegations in the Rules of
Court, being merely procedural, have been repealed,
and this repeal has retroactive effect.

another law.

695 SCRA 639

Settled is the principle which the Supreme Court has
affirmed in a number of cases the stipulated interest rates
are excessive, iniquitous,
of 3% per month and higher
unconscionable, and exorbitant. (Agner v. BPI Family Savings
Bank, Inc., 697 SCRA 89)

—

FACTS: The Commissioner of Internal Revenue imposed
delinquency interest amounting at the rate of 20% per annum.

ISSUE: Is this proper?
HELD: The imposition is proper because failure to pay
the deficiency tax assessed within the time prescribed for its
payment by virtue of Sec. 249(cX3) of the National Internal
Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 justifies the imposition of interest
at the rate of 20% p.a., which interest shall be assessed and
collected from the date prescribed for its payment until full
payment is made.
[NOTA BENE: It is worthy to note that tax revenue
statutes are not generally intended to be literally construed.

(9) Loans Extended by Banks

Section 109 of RA 265 covered only loans extended by
banks, whereas under Sec. 1-a of the Usury Law, as amended,
the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board (BSP-MB)
may prescribe the maximum rate or rates of interest for all
loans or renewals thereof or the forbearance of any money,
goods or credits, including those for loans of low priority such
as consumer loans, as well as such loans made by pawnshops,
finance companies, and similar credit institution.

(2008)

FACTS: The stipulated interest rates involved were 3%
and 3.81% per month on a PIO million loan.
ISSUE: Were the stipulated interest rates proper?
HELD: According to the Supreme Court

“we find [the stipulated interest rates] under the
circumstances excessive.”
In that respect, the highest tribunal reduced the same
(stipulate interest rates) to 1% per month.

(14) Imposition of Delinquency Interest

First Lepanto Taisho Insurance Corp. v.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue
695 SCRA 639
ISSUE: Does the failure to pay the deficiency tax assessed
within the time prescribed for its payment justify the imposition
of interest at the rate of 20% per annum?
HELD: Yes. The imposition of delinquency interest of 20%
under Sec. 249(cX3) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code
(NIRC) is proper.
The imposition of the delinquency tax due to the taxpayer’s
failure to pay or time the deficiency tax assessment within the
time prescribed by the NIRC for said payment.
Accordingly, the deficiency tax assessment of 20%
corresponds to the interest that shall be assessed and collected
from the date prescribed for its payment until full payment is

made.
(15) Instance Where a Stipulation Remains Valid and Binding

Andal v. PNB
711 SCRA 15
FACTS: The rate of interest was subsequently declared
illegal and unconscionable.
ISSUE: Does said circumstance entitle petitioners-spouses
to step payment of interest?
HELD: There is no entitlement to speak of. It should be
emphasized that only the rate or interest was declared void. The
stipulation requiring petitioners-spouses to pay interest on their
loan remains valid and binding.
(16) Absence of an ‘Express’ Stipulation

In the absence of an “express stipulation as to the rate
of interest that would govern the parties, the rate of legal

interest for loans or forbearance of any money, goods, or credits
and the rate allowed in the judgments shall no longer be 12%

(234 SCRA 78 [1994]), and Subsection X305.1 of the Manual
of Regulations for Banks and Secs. 4305 Q.l, 4305 S.3, and
4303 (703 SCRA 1) of the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank
Financial Institutions, before its amendment by Bangko Sentral
ng Pilipinas — Monetary Board (BSP ME) Circular 799 but
will now be 6% p.a. effective July 1, 2013.

Notably, the BSP-MB may prescribe the maximum rate
or rates of interest for all loans or renewals thereof or the
forbearance of any money, goods, or credits, including those for
loans of low priority such as consumer loans, as well as such
loans made by pawnshops, finance companies, and similar credit

institutions.
[NOTA BENE: Pursuant to Circular 799, series of 2013,
issued by the office of the BSP Governor on June 21, 2013, and
in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling in Nacar (supra),
the interest rate for the loan or forbearance of any money, goods,
or credits and the rate allowed in judgments absent an express
contract as to such interest rate shall be 6% p.a. (Andal v.
PNB, supra) Following the same holding in Nacar (supra), the
legal interest of 6% p.a. must be imposed in lieu of the excessive
interest stipulated in an agreement. (Benavidez v. Salvador, 712

—

SCRA 238)]
(17) Query

In a usurious loan with mortgage, does the right to foreclose
the mortgage subsist?
ANS.: Yes, and this right can be exercised by the creditor
upon failure by the debtor to pay the debt due.

In Advocates for Truth in Lending, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral
Monetary Board, 688 SCRA 530, the Supreme Court held the
view that the debt due in said case is considered as without the
stipulated excessive interest, and the legal interest of 12% per
annum will be added in place of the excessive interest formerly
imposed.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1176

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1176. The receipt of the principal by the creditor,
without reservation with respect to the interest, shall give
rise to the presumption that said interest has been paid.

The receipt of a later installment of a debt without
reservation as to prior installment, shall likewise raise the
presumption that such installments have been paid.

COMMENT:
(1) Example of Par. 1 (Receipt of Principal without
Reservation as to Interest)

A creditor of Pl,000,000, with 8% interest, received
Pl,000,000 in payment of the principal. Interest was not referred
to in the payment. It is presumed that the 8% interest had
already been previously paid. This is because under Art. 1253,
Civil Code, payment of the interest as a rule precedes payment
of the principal. (Of course, Art. 1176 establishes merely a
rebuttable, not a conclusive presumption.) (See Hill v. Veloso, 31
Phil. 160; and Vda. de Ongsiaco v. Cabatuando, L-10738, March
19, 1959) Thus, even if there is a receipt evidencing payment
of the principal, the accumulated interest may in certain cases
still be recovered. (See Magdalena Estates, Inc. v. Rodriguez,
L-18411, Dec. 17, 1966)

on a certain month. Thus, if the date of the receipt is January,
1999, this fact alone by itself cannot justify the inference that
the January installment had been paid. The receipt may have
been for a prior installment.]
Art. 1177. The creditors, after having pursued the
property in possession of the debtor to satisfy their claims,
may exercise all the rights and bring all the actions of the
latter for the same purpose, save those which are inherent in
his person; they may also impugn the acts which the debtor
may have done to defraud them.

(2) Example of Par. 2 (Receipt of a Later Installment)

If a creditor receives the fourth installment of a debt, it is
understood that the first three installments have been paid.
[NOTE: If I pay my income tax this year, no presumption
arises about my payment of the tax last year. Taxes payable by
the year cannot be considered installments.]
[NOTE: The presumption in par. 2 is also rebuttable.

1961)}
[NOTE: In Manila Trading & Supply Co. v. Medina,
L-16477, May 31, 1961, it was ruled that for the presumption in
par. 2, Art. 1176 to apply, it is not enough that the receipt for the
installment paid be dated; it must also specify that the receipt
is for the payment of a particular installment due, for example,

Regalado v. Luchasingco and Co.
5 Phil. 625

FACTS: A was a defendant in a civil case. He lost, and
attachment was issued against his property. B, the winner,
could not collect his claim because it was discovered that A had
sold his warehouse to his son, C, after attachment had been
issued on such property. B, who could not collect in any other
191

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1177

way because A had no money, brought an action to rescind the
contract allegedly made to defraud him. It was proved that:
1) Although the warehouse was worth P25.000, the son
allegedly paid only P15.O00 for it;
2) The son probably did not have the P15.000 or any other
sum of importance with which to buy the said warehouse.

HELD: The transaction is fraudulent and since B, the
creditor, cannot recover in any other way, the contract ought to
be rescinded.

Serrano v. Central Bank, et al.
L-30511, Feb. 14, 1980
To recover time deposits plus interest from a distressed
bank, the claim must be ventilated in the Court of First Instance

Republic v. Emilio Guanzon
L-22374, Dec. 18, 1974

FACTS: Emilio Guanzon borrowed money from the Bank
of Taiwan during the Japanese occupation. Security was given
in the form of a read mortgage on two parcels, and a chattel
mortgage on the crops growing on said parcels. When the
Philippines was liberated in 1946, the mortgage credit was
acquired by the United States, and later transferred to the
Philippines through the Philippine Property Act of 1946 (of the
U.S. Congress, and therefore, a foreign law). The Philippines
then filed an action for foreclosure. The lower court dismissed
the action, firstly, on the ground that the Philippines is not a
party-in-interest (has no real legal interest in the mortgage
loans), and secondly, on the ground that the foreign law cited
cannot be taken judicial notice of, and resultantly, cannot be
effective in our country.
HELD:
(a)

The Philippines has legal interest in the mortgage loans,
because the mortgage credit was transferred to our
government by the U.S. through the Philippine Property
Act of 1946 (a foreign law duly acquiesced in by both the
executive and legislative branches of our government).

Art. 1179

Section 1
PURE AND CONDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS
Art. 1179. Every obligation whose performance does not
depend upon a future or uncertain event, or upon a past event
unknown to the parties, is demandable at once.
Every obligation which contains a resolutory condition
shall also be demandable, without prejudice to the effects of
the happening of the event.

COMMENT:

—

one without a condition or a term (hence,
demandable at once, provided there will be no absurdity).

(1) Pure Obligation

Examples:
(a)

154), or when some time is reasonably necessary for the
actual fulfillment of the obligation, as when a person binds
himself to pay immediately for the subscription of corporate
shares of stock. (Paul Schenker v. William F. Gemperle,
L16449, Aug. 31, 1962))
(b) “I’ll pay you Pl million on demand.” (See Abarri, Inc. v.
Galan, 47 O.G. 6241) But instant performance is not a
necessity, otherwise absurd consequences will arise. (8
Manresa 172)
(c) When the original period or condition has been cancelled
by the mutual stipulation of both parties. (See Estate of
Mota v. Serram, 47 Phil. 464)

— when there is a condition.

Example:
(a) I’ll buy your land for PIO million if you pass the last bar
examinations. (This is suspensive for the results will be
awaited.)

(b)

Art. 1179

(3) Definition of Condition

“It is an uncertain event which wields an influence on a
legal relationship.” Manresa.

—

(4) Definition of a Term or Period

That which necessarily must come (like 2005) whether the
parties know when it will happen or not (like death, since this
is sure).
[NOTE: Death because of SA.R.S. is a condition, since
death may be due to other causes.]
Example: “I’ll pay you Pl million on June 1, 2005.”
(5) When an Obligation Is Demandable at Once

When it is pure',
(b) Or when it has a resolutory condition.
(Example: I’ll give you my car, but you should not
marry Maria this year.) (This is demandable NOW.)
[NOTE: If the obligation is worded this way —
“Til give you my car, but only after you can prove that
by the end of this year, you have not married Maria”
this is suspensive, because the end of the testing
period must be awaited.]

(a)

I promise to pay you Pl million. [This is demandable at
once, unless a period was really intended, as when a loan
has just been contracted (See Floriano v. Delgado, 11 Phil.

(2) Conditional Obligation

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

I’ll give you my land now, but should you fail in the last bar
examinations, your ownership will cease and it will be mine
again. (This is resolutory because it ends upon failure.)

—

(6) Past Event Unknown to the Parties

This is not exactly a condition since, as a matter of reality,
the thing has already happened or not. What is really meant
here is, future knowledge of a past event will determine whether
or not an obligation will arise. (See 8 Manresa 120121) Hence,
a condition is really “a future AND certain event,” not “a future
OR uncertain event."(J.B.L. Reyes, Observation on the New Civil
Code, Lawyer's Journal, Jan. 31, 1951, p. 47)

Although it may seem that Art. 1180 speaks of a condition

apparently VOID under Art. 1182), the fact remains that
payment does not depend on debtor’s will, for indeed he had
promised payment. What depends really on him is not payment,
but the TIME when payment is to be made. Hence, the law

It is obvious that to leave the same to the discretion of
either creditor or debtor would be unjust, therefore, Art. 1197
should be applied, where the Court is obliged to fix the duration
of the period. The general rule is, therefore, for the creditor to
ask the court first for the fixing of the term, and it is only when
that term set arrives that he can demand fulfillment. Any action

“as soon as possible or as soon as I have money.” The only case
when the bringing of the action to enforce, before the court fixes
the term, would be allowed is when the prior action of fixing the
term would serve no purpose but delay. (Tiglao, et al. v. Manila
Railroad Co., 98 Phil. 181)

should be considered as partaking of the nature of
a suspensive condition. If the bond be not given,
enforcement or execution can issue. (See Santos v.
Mojica, L-24266, Jan. 24, 1964)

Art. 1181. In conditional obligations, the acquisition of
rights, as well as the extinguishment or loss of those already
acquired, shall depend upon the happening of the event which
constitutes the condition.

ISSUE: If a contract provides for arbitration prior
to recourse to courts but the case was filed without such
needed arbitration, should the case be dismissed?
HELD: No, for the remedy should be to suspend the
case until after arbitration is resorted to. (See also RA.
No. 876, otherwise known as the Arbitration Law)

COMMENT:
(1) Suspensive and Resolutory Conditions

This Article treats of:
(a) suspensive conditions
the happening of which will give
rise to the acquisition of a right (also called conditions
precedent or conditions antecedent). Be it noted that what
characterizes an obligation with a suspensive condition is
the fact that its efficacy or obligatory force is subordinated
to the happening of a future and uncertain event; if the
suspensive condition does not take place, the parties would
stand as if the conditional obligation had never existed.

during said period. Since the suspensive condition
was not complied with, B is not entitled to inherit.

expired license, the insurance company would not be liable.

Integrated Construction v. Relova
GR 41117, Dec. 29, 1986

FACTS: A decision-award by an arbitration board
ordered the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage
System (MWSS) to pay Integrated Construction P13,188.50.
Later, Integrated agreed to give MWSS some discounts
provided MWSS would pay the amount on Oct. 17, 1972.
MWSS, however, paid only on Dec. 22, 1972, the amount
stated in the decision less the reductions. Three years
later, Integrated moved for execution against MWSS for

Art 1181

the balance due under the decision-award. MWSS opposed
the execution setting forth the defense of payment. The
judge denied the execution on the ground that the parties
had novated the award by their subsequent agreement.
HELD: While the tenor of the subsequent agreement
in a sense novates the judgment award there being a
shortening of the period within which to pay, the suspensive
and conditional nature of the said agreement (making the
novation conditional) is acknowledged by MWSS. Its failure
to pay within the stipulated period removed the very cause
for the agreement, rendering the same ineffective and,
therefore, the parties were remitted to their original rights
under the judgment award.

resolutory conditions (also called conditions subsequent)
here, rights already acquired are lost once the condition
is fulfilled.

I’ll give you my car now but should you pass the bar,
the donation will not be effective. If you pass the bar,
you must return the car to me.

Parks v. Prov. of Tarlac
49 Phil. 142

FACTS: Concepcion Cerir and James Hill
donated land to the province of Tarlac on condition
that the latter would build upon the land a schoolhouse
and a park, the work to begin within six months from
the date the parties ratify the donation. The province
accepted the donation, and the land was registered in
the name of the donee. Several years later, noticing
that the province had not performed the conditions,
the donors sold the land to Mr. Parks. Now Parks
sued to recover the land from the province.
HELD: Parks has no right to get the land. It
is true that the donation was revocable because of
breach of the conditions. But until the donation was
revoked, it remained valid, and hence, Cirir and Hill
had no right to sell the land to Parks. One cannot give
206

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1181

what he does not have (nemo dat quod non habet).
What the donors should have done first was to have
the donation annulled. And after that was done, they
could validly have disposed of the land in favor of
Parks.

But there is one more point to be answered. The
donors contend that the condition set forth
the
was in the nature of a suspensive
construction
condition (condition precedent), that is, since the
condition never happened, there really was no
donation, and if there was no donation, there is no
donation to be annulled. Hence, the donors insist on
their right to sell the property to Parks. Are the donors
correct here?

—

—

HELD: No. The condition imposed was not a
condition precedent. It is not true that the schoolhouse
and the park had to be constructed before the donation
became effective, that is, before the province could
become the owner of the land; otherwise, it would be
invading the property rights of the donors. Hence,
the donation had to become valid even before the
fulfillment of the condition. Hence, the condition is a
resolutory one. Inasmuch as although revocable, the
donation had not yet been revoked, it follows that in
the meantime, it is valid and, therefore, the sale by
the donors to Parks is not valid. Hence, Parks has no
right to recover the property.
[Author’s Note: It is submitted that it is not
correct to say that one has to be first the owner of the
land before he can be allowed to build on it. One can
very well do so upon the owner’s permission, and it
is evident that in this case, the owners (the donors)
were already granting permission.!
(2) Conditional Perfection of a Contract

If the perfection of a contract depends upon the fulfillment
of a condition, non-fulfillment thereof means the non-perfection
of the contract since the suspensive condition should have been
first fulfilled. (Ruperto u. Kosca, 26 Phil. 227)

ISSUE: Will the case now be dismissed?

Panganiban v. Batangas Trans. Co.
(C.A.) 46 O.G. 3167
FACTS: The Batangas Transportation Company bound
itself to furnish a certain number of trucks provided they were
available on the day needed. On said day no truck was available.

HELD: No, the case will not be dismissed, although there
was no prior resort to arbitration. This is so because under the
Arbitration Law (RA 876), in a case like this, what the Court
should do is to refer the matter to the arbitrators who are
supposed to be selected by the parties.

ISSUE: Was the Company bound still to supply the trucks?
HELD: The Company never incurred the obligation since
the condition did not materialize.

If a statute requires the putting up of a bond, it is
understood that the conditions prescribed by the statute shall
form part of the bond agreement.

L-15862, July 31, 1961

A condition contained in an insurance policy that claims
must be presented within one year after rejection is not merely
a procedural requirement, but in the nature of a condition
precedent to the liability of the insurer, or in other words,
a resolutory clause, the purpose of which is to terminate all
liabilities in case the action is not filed by the insured within
the period stipulated.

dependent on the realization of profits. If there be no profits,
there will be no bonus.
Bengson v. Chan
L-27283, July 29, 1977

FACTS: In a contract for the construction of a condominium
building, it was expressly agreed that should there be any
dispute, a board of arbitrators must first be resorted to before
taking any judicial action. The owner went to court because the
building was not finished on time, but there was no prior resort

L-48210, Jan. 31, 1984

In fixing the amount of a bond for the grant of a preliminary
injunction, two factors that may be considered are the market
value of the property, and the possible resultant damage if it
should turn out that the injunction should not have been granted.
(4) Where Payment of the Price Is a Positive Suspensive

Condition
Bonrostro v. Luna
702 SCRA 1
In a contract to sell, payment of the price is a positive
suspensive condition, failure of which is not a breach of contract
warranty rescission but rather just an event that prevents the
supposed seller from being bound to convey title to the supposed
buyer.
Art. 1182. When the fulfillment of the condition depends
upon the sole will of the debtor, the conditional obligation
shall be void. If it depends upon chance or upon the will of
a third person, the obligation shall take effect in conformity
with the provisions of this Code.

similar case, held that such a stipulation is VOID), still it is not
purely potestative (as distinguished from the simply potestative)

Smith, Bell and Co. v. Sotelo Matti
44 Phil. 874
FACTS: A sold merchandise to B, said merchandise to be
delivered in three months, but the period of delivery was not
guaranteed. Although A tried his best to fulfill his commitments
on time, still transportation and government red tape made
delivery possible only after three months. Whereupon B refused
to accept the goods and to pay for them on the ground that the
term had not been complied with.

HELD: B should accept and pay, for there was really no
term but a mixed condition. Considering that A had already
tried his best, it is as if all the terms of the contract had been
faithfully complied with, for here the fulfillment of the condition
did not depend purely on his will but on others, like the shipping
company and the government. B should now comply.

impossible, just disregard the condition BUT the obligation
remains.
Example: Fil sell you my land if you cannot make a
circle that is at the same time a square. (This becomes a
pure and valid obligation. As a matter of fact, the condition
here can always be fulfilled.)
If the condition is NEGATIVE, i.e., not to do an illegal
thing, both the condition and the obligation are VALID.
Example: IH sell you my land if you do not kill X. (This
is valid. If X is killed by you, you have no right to buy my
land.)

(NOTE: The example given above applies only to
obligations and contracts, not to testamentary disposition or
to donations. In said case, the impossible or illegal condition
is just disregarded, and the disposition or donation remains
valid. (See Arts. 873 and 727, Civil Code)]

liberality of the giver that is the consideration of the gift.]

(1) Impossible and Illegal Conditions

sureties. The bond contained a statement that in case A should

(2) Effect If Period of Fulfillment Is Not Fixed

If the period is not fixed in the contract, the court,
considering the parties’ intentions, should determine what
period was really intended. (See Art. 1185, par. 2, Civil Code)

Martin v. Boyero
55 Phil. 760

FACTS: A sold B a parcel of land on condition that the price
would be paid as soon as B had paid off the mortgage and other
debts of the estate. A waited for some time, but since B had not
yet succeeded in paying off the debts, A brought an action to
cancel the sale.
HELD: The sale will not be cancelled. There was no time
stipulated here, and besides, B was trying his best to comply
with his agreement. So B must be given more time.

Art. 1185. The condition that some event will not happen
at a determinate time shall render the obligation effective
from the moment the time indicated has elapsed, or if it has
become evident that the event cannot occur.
If no time has been fixed, the condition shall be deemed
fulfilled at such time as may have probably been contemplated,

217

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

was that since he did not put up the bond, there was no contract
since the condition was not complied with.
HELD: Valencia is liable. Firstly, the putting up of the
performance bond was not a condition before he could be
compelled to make the installation, although of course it was a
condition before he could insist on working and on getting paid.
Secondly, assuming that the condition was indeed conditional,
it was he who voluntarily prevented its fulfillment; therefore,
he can be held liable.

FACTS: A employed B for two years unless within six

the end of six months, B was discharged. B now claims salary
for the period of two years on the ground that the debtor (A) had
voluntarily prevented compliance with the condition.

HELD: B has no right. First, because the condition here is
resolutory and not suspensive; second, it was expressly agreed
that the failure to arrive could be for “any reason,” including
A’s own acts. Ordinary words should be given their ordinary
significations, unless the parties intended otherwise.

once the condition has been fulfilled, shall retroact to the day
of the constitution of the obligation. Nevertheless, when the
obligation imposes reciprocal prestations upon the parties,

obligation is unilateral, the debtor shall appropriate the
fruits and interests received, unless from the nature and
circumstances of the obligation it should be inferred that the
intention of the person constituting the same was different.
In obligations to do and not to do, the courts shall
determine, in each case, the retroactive effect of the condition
that has been complied with.

COMMENT:
(1) Effects of Fulfillment of Suspensive Conditions

The obligation becomes effective.

From what day?

—

(a)

RETROACTS (as a general rule) to the day the obligation
was constituted.

(b)

No retroactivity with reference only to:
1)

fruits or interests. (Art. 1187, Civil Code)

2)

period of prescription. (Hermosa case, GR L-5267,

condition was fulfilled, because it can be enforced only
from said date.

Although in general, Art. 1186 applies only to a suspensive
condition, it may sometimes apply to a resolutory condition as
in this case:

CONSENSUAL contracts (like sale), and not to real
contracts (such as deposit or commodatum), which
are perfected only upon delivery.]

(3) No Retroactive Effects as to Fruits and Interests

In unilateral obligations, debtor gets the fruits and
interests unless there is a contrary intent.
Example: In 2005, A promised to give B his (A’s) land
if B passes the bar in 2006. If the condition is fulfilled,
does A also give the fruits for the period of one year? NO,
by express provision of the law unless there is a contrary
intent.

(4) Scope of “Fruita”

any donation or mortgage made by Maria in 2004
(before passing) will be considered valid. (Under the
law of donations, future property cannot as a rule be
donated, but inasmuch as Maria is entitled to the land
effective 2004, it follows that the property cannot be
considered a future one. The same is true with regard
to a mortgage, for under the law, the mortgagor must
be the owner). (These are acts pendente conditionae.)

In reciprocal obligations, the fruits and interests during

unequal).

agreed to pay if C passes the bar of 2006. C passed. A must
now give the land, and B must pay. The fruits of the land
for the one-year period will remain with A, i.e., A does not
have to give said fruits. Upon the other hand, B will keep
the 6% legal interest on his money. This is true even if the
interests be greater or lesser than the fruits.

“Fruits” here refer to natural, industrial, and civil fruits
(like rent). (See Art. 442, Civil Code)

Art. 1188. The creditor may, before the fulfillment of the
condition, bring the appropriate actions for the preservation
of his right.
The debtor may recover what during the same time he
has paid by mistake in case of a suspensive condition.

COMMENT:
(1) First Paragraph (Actions to Preserve Creditor’s Rights)
(a) Reason: If not allowed to take the appropriate actions, there
is a danger the creditor will receive nothing, as when the
object is deliberately destroyed, or hidden, or alienated.
(b) “Bring appropriate actions." According to Justice J.B.L.
Reyes, this means to sue in court. He says “take appropriate
action” would be a better phrase, since this would include
not only suits in court, but also such remedies as recording
(of the expected right) with the Register of Deeds. (See
Lawyers’ Journal, Jan. 31, 1951, p. 47)

Other appropriate actions:
ask for security if the debtor is about to be insolvent.
2)
ask the court to prevent alienation or concealment

(c) “Preservation”: Note that the law says “preservation,” not
‘preference* over other creditor. (Jacinto v. de Leon, 51

Phil. Long Distance Telephone Co. v. Jeturian
L-7758, July 30, 1955

FACTS: The Phil. Long Distance Telephone Co. operated
a pension plan prior to the last Pacific War, whereby, subject to
certain conditions (such as age and length of service), employees
who retire would be given pensions. After the war, the plan
was abolished because of losses sustained during the Japanese
occupation.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1189

ISSUES:
(a)

Would financial losses during the war authorize abolition
of the plan?

HELD:
(a)

Pending fulfillment of the conditions, the employees have
a right in expectancy, which the law protects. Hence, under
Art. 1188, appropriate actions may be taken by them.

(b)

Financial losses will not excuse abolition of the pension
plan because the obligation to pay money is an obligation
to give a GENERIC thing.

(2) Second Paragraph (Right of Debtor to Recover What Was
Paid by Mistake)

Reason: What was paid by mistake may be recovered
because, after all, the condition may not materialize. In the
meantime, the debtor has lost the use of the object. It is
unfair for the creditor to uiyustly enrich himself. This is a
case ofSOLUTIO INDEBITI (undue payment). The debtor
is also entitled to fruits or legal interest if the creditor be
in BAD FAITH, that is, if the creditor knew that payment
was being made prior to the fulfillment of the condition.
(b) If payment was not by “mistake” (that is, it was done
deliberately), can there be recovery?
(a)

ANS.: It depends:

Pending fulfillment of the conditions (such as the employee’s
service), do the employees have any right with respect to

the pension plan?
(b)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If the condition is fulfilled, no recovery because of
retroactivity (already discussed).
If the condition is not fulfilled, there should be a
recovery (for this would be unjust enrichment) unless
a pure donation was intended.

Art. 1189. When the conditions have been imposed with
the intention of suspending the efficacy of an obligation
to give, the following rules shall be observed in case of the

pendency of the condition:

(1) If the thing is lost without the fault of the debtor,
the obligation shall be extinguished;
(2) If the thing is lost through the fault of the debtor,
he shall be obliged to pay damages; it is understood that the
thing is lost when it perishes, or goes out of commerce, or
disappears in such a way that its existence is unknown or it
cannot be recovered;
(3) When the thing deteriorates without the fault of the
debtor, the impairment is to be borne by the creditor;
(4) If it deteriorates through the fault of the debtor, the
creditor may choose between the rescission of the obligation
and its fulfillment, with indemnity for damages in either case;
(5) If the thing is improved by its nature, or by time, the
improvement shall inure to the benefit of the creditor;
(6) If it is improved at the expense of the debtor, he shall
have no other right than that granted to the usufructuary.

It may be partial loss:

considered a complete loss (this will be determined by the
courts). (Art. 1263, Civil Code)

A promised to give B Pl,000,000 if B passes the bar.
Pending the results of the bar, A’s money is destroyed by
fire, not imputable to A. When B passes the bar, does A
still have to give him Pl,000,000?
ANS.: Yes, because the money here is generic. “In an
obligation to deliver a generic thing the loss or destruction
of anything of the same kind does not extinguish the
obligation.” (Art. 1263, Civil Code) The reason is “Genus
nunquam peruit’ “genus never perishes.’
Suppose the loss occurred through the fault of the debtor,
is the debtor liable?

—

ANS.: Yes. “If the thing is lost through the fault of
the debtor, he shall be obliged to pay damages.” (Art. 1189,

(d)

A promised to give B his car if B passes the bar. Pending
the results of the bar exams, the car is destroyed by a
fortuitous event, without any fault at all on the part of
the debtor. When B passes the bar, does A have to give B
anything?

ANS.: No, A does not have to give B anything. “If the
thing is lost without the fault of the debtor, the obligation
shall be extinguished.” ( 1st par., Art. 1189, Civil Code) The
reason is that as a general rule, no one should be liable
for a fortuitous event unless otherwise provided by law or

(2) “Loss” Defined

It is understood that the thing is lost:

(d)

Suppose pending the fulfillment of the suspensive condition,
the object, say a particular car, deteriorates without the
fault of the debtor, is the debtor bound to make up for the
depreciation, or should the creditor bear the deterioration

suffered?
ANS.: In such a case, the creditor will have to suffer
the deterioration or impairment. The law says: “When
the thing deteriorates without the fault of the debtor, the

Or fulfillment of the obligation (even if there has been
deterioration) plus damages. (Art. 1189, par. 4, Civil

Code)

Suppose the thing is improved by nature or by time, who
gets the benefit of the improvement?
ANS.: The creditor gets the benefit. “If the thing is
improved by its nature or by time, the improvement shall
inure (go) to the benefit of the creditor." (Art. 1189, par. 5,
Civil Code) The reason for this is to compensate the creditor
who would suffer in case, instead of improvement, there
would be deterioration without the fault of the debtor.
(g) Suppose the thing has improved, not through time or by
its nature but through the expense of the debtor, what will
be the rights of said debtor?
ANS.: The debtor will have the rights granted to
a usufructuary for improvements on a thing held in
usufruct. (Usufruct is the right to the enjoyment of the
use and the fruits of a thing.) These rights granted to
the usufructuary with reference to improvements may
be found in Art. 579 of the Civil Code, which reads as
follows: “The usufructuary may make on the property
held in usufruct such useful improvements or expenses for
mere pleasure as he may deem proper, provided he does
not alter its form or substance; but he shall not have the
right to be indemnified therefor. He may, however, remove
such improvements, should it be possible to do so without
damage to the property.” In other words, he is not entitled
to reimbursement but he may remove the improvements
provided he does not, by doing so, damage the property.
“He may however set off the improvements he may have
made on the property against any damage to the same.

(f)

Suppose the improvement is due partly to the expenses
made by the debtor and partly due to its nature or by time,
who gets the benefit?

ANS.: The creditor gets the benefit of the improvement
of the thing by its nature or by time, but the debtor
is entitled to the rights of a usufructuary over useful
improvements that may have been caused at his expense.

(2) Problems
(a)

A gave B a parcel of land on the condition that B will never
go to the casino. A month later, B went to the casino. What
happens to A’s obligation?

ANS.: A’s obligation is extinguished, and therefore it
as
is if there never was an obligation at all. B will therefore
have to return both the land and the fruits he had received
therefrom from the moment A had given him the land.
(b)

Suppose in the meantime, the land had been improved
through its nature or by time, who benefits from such

improvements?
ANS.: A gets the benefit because he is now the creditor
with respect to the recovery of the land. (Art. 1189, par. 5,
Civil Code)
Art. 1191. The power to rescind obligations is implied in
reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply
with what is incumbent upon him.

The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and
the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages
in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has
chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.
The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless
there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.
This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights
of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance
with Articles 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law.

Art 1191

referred to here is not predicated on injury to economic interests
on the part of the party plaintiff (which is the basis for the
rescission mentioned in Arts. 1380 and 1381, Civil Code), but on
the breach of faith by the defendant, which breach is violative of
the reciprocity between the parties. (Universal Food Corporation
v. Court of Appeals, L-29155, May 13, 1970)
Spouses Mariano Z. Velarde & Avelina D.

Velarde v. Court of Appeals, David A. Raymundo
& George Raymundo
GR 108346, July 11, 2001

FACTS: Petitioners failed to comply with their obligation
to pay the balance of the purchase price to private respondents.
ISSUE: Because of the failure, were private respondents
correct in validly exercising their right to rescind the contract?
HELD: Yes. Indubitably, petitioners violated the very
essence of reciprocity in the contract of sale, a violation that
consequently gave rise to private respondents’ right to rescind
the same in accordance with law. Stated in another modality, a
substantial breach of a reciprocal obligation, like failure to pay
the price in the manner prescribed by the contract, entitles the
injured party to rescind the obligation. Rescission abrogates the
contrast from its inception and requires a mutual restitution of
benefits received.
Rescission creates the obligation to return the object of the
contract. It can be carried out only when the one who demands
rescission can return whatever he may be obliged to restore. (Co.
v. CA, 312 SCRA 528 [1999]) To rescind is to declare a contract
void at its inception and to put an end to it as though it never
was. It is not merely to terminate it and release the parties
from further obligations to each other, but to abrogate it from
the beginning and restore the parties to their relative positions
as if no contract has been made. (Ocampo v. CA, 233 SCRA 551
[1994])
(2) Reciprocal Obligations

(1) Right to Rescind

“The power to rescind,” as used in this Article, means the
right to cancel (or resolve) the contract or reciprocal obligations in
case of non-fulfillment on the part of one. Thus, the “rescission

This Article in speaking of “reciprocal ones’ refers only to
reciprocal obligations, that is, to obligations where two parties are
reciprocally obliged to do or give something. (Example: contract
229

228

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1191

of sale) It is not enough that both parties are indebted to each
other. The cause must be IDENTICAL and the obligations should
arise simultaneously. (See 8 Manresa 255) Parenthetically, in
reciprocal contracts or transactions, the obligation or promise
of each party is the cause or consideration for the obligation or
promise of the other. (Vda. de Quirino v. Palarca, L-28269, Aug.
15, 1969)
(3) What Is Implied In a Reciprocal Obligation

The power to rescind the obligations of the injured party
is implied in reciprocal obligations. (Maglasang v. Northwestern
University, Inc., 694 SCRA 128)
As presently warded, Art. 1191 speaks of the remedy of
rescission in reciprocal obligations within the context of Art.
1124 of the former Civil Code which used the term “resolution.”
(San Miguel Properties, Inc. v. Perez, 705 SCRA 38)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1191

(5) Examples
(a)

In a contract of sale, the buyer can rescind if the seller does
not deliver, or the seller can rescind if the buyer does not
pay. (This is all right for this is a reciprocal obligation.)

(b)

A borrowed Pl,000,000 from B as a loan. A, on the other
hand, is the owner of a garage where B deposits (for
safekeeping) his car. B owes A Pl,000,000 for deposit fees. Is
this a reciprocal obligation? No. Although they are mutually
bound, the cause does not arise from the same contract. One
is the contract of loan; the other is the contract of deposit.
The payment of Pl,000,000 as a loan does not depend on
the payment of Pl,000,000 as deposit fees.
[NOTE: In the above case of deposit, which
incidentally is, by itself, a reciprocal obligation, the duty to
pay deposit fees has its reciprocal counterpart in the duty
to safely keep the car.]

L-39378, Aug. 28, 1984

In an action to rescind or for specific performance, the latter
was granted, but the same later became impossible (in view of
the cancellation of certain titles). May the remedy of rescission
still be granted? Yes, under Art. 1191 of the Civil Code, since
specific performance has now become impossible because the
titles of the lots (formerly in the name of the defendants) have
already been nullified or cancelled, so that defendants can no
longer deliver their ownership to plaintiffs.

If a lessee agrees with his lessor to pay rent partly in
corporate shares, it is the regular courts (not the Securities and
Exchange Commission) that has jurisdiction over a complaint for
specific performance and delivery of personal property. There is
no intra-corporate controversy. The mere fact that the lessor also
wants to be regarded as a stockholder is immaterial. In fact, this
desire merely indicates that the lessor is not yet.a stockholder.

FACTS: A sold to B some properties. It was agreed thatB,
the buyer, should take care of perfecting within six months the
title papers to the property. This duty B was not able to do.

ISSUE: Despite the fact that B has already paid the price,
may A, the seller, resolve the contract on the ground thatB had
not complied with the obligation referred to above?
HELD: No. In a case of sale, the corresponding duties are:
for the seller to deliver, and for the buyer to pay. Here the buyer
has paid. Therefore, the seller cannot resolve just because the
title papers had not yet been perfected. Had the buyer not yet
paid, it would have been a different story. (See also Borromeo

liters of gasoline monthly from the defendant, but the plaintiff
refuses to sign said agreement, the defendant is absolved from
its obligation. The reason is simple. In reciprocal obligations,
the performance of one is conditioned on the simultaneous
fulfillment of the other.

to present his side before the duly constituted Arbitration Board.
Otherwise stated, there was no denial of due process.

Central Bank v. Court of Appeals
GR 45710, Oct. 3, 1985
The borrower’s promise to pay is the consideration for
the obligation of a lender-bank to furnish the amount being
borrowed. When the borrower executes a real estate mortgage,
he signifies his willingness to pay the loan. From such date, the
obligation of the lender-bank to give the amount of loan, accrues,
and from that date, the lender-bank’s delay in furnishing the
entire loan starts.

Pio Barreto Sons, Inc. v. Compania Maritime
L-22358, Jan. 29, 1975

FACTS: A lumber company sued to collect a certain amount
from a customer as payment for lumber purchased on credit. The
CFI (now RTC) decided in favor of the lumber company, but the
CA reversed the CFI (RTC) on the ground that the delivery of the
lumber had not been proved. It is now contended by the lumber
company that the CA should not have touched on the issue of
delivery, because the issue touched upon by the CFI (RTC) was
the issue of whether or not payment had been made.
ISSUE: Should the issue of delivery be touched upon?
HELD: Yes, the issue of delivery should be touched upon
because delivery and payment in a contract of sale are so
interrelated that in the absence of delivery of the goods, there is
generally no corresponding obligation yet for the buyer to pay.
(See Art. 1458, par. 1, Civil Code)

(6) Characteristics of the Right to Rescind or Resolve Under

This Article
(a)

It exists only in reciprocal obligations. (Art. 1191, Civil
Code). (Be it noted, however, that if the obligation is
reciprocal BUT with a period, neither party can demand
performance or be considered in default before the
expiration of the period. (Abesamis v. Woodcraft Works,

Ltd., L-18916, Nov. 18, 1969)]
(b)

It can be demanded only if the plaintiff is ready, willing,
and able to comply with his own obligation, and the other
is not. [Otherwise, if neither is ready, neither can resolve.
Moreover, the guilty party cannot rescind. He who comes
to equity must come with clean hands. ( See Seva v. Berwia,
48 Phil. 581)]

(c)

The right to rescind is NOT absolute. Thus:
1) Trivial causes or slight breaches will not cause
rescission. (.Song Fo v. Hawaiian-Phil. Co., 47 Phil.
where the court refused rescission when
821
there was a short delay in the payment of molasses.)
[However, a substantial breach of an employee’s
obligations is sufficient cause to put an end to a
contract of employment before the period for the
termination of such employment. (Marcaida v. Phil.
Educ. Co., L-9960, May 29, 1957; and De la Cruz v.
Legaspi, 51 O.G. 6212)]

Santiago v. Gonzales
L-36627, Oct. 20, 1977

FACTS: The building contractor in a construction contract,
not having been paid properly for the work, decided to stop the
construction and to cancel or rescind the contract. As a result of
the rescission, both parties agreed to submit the dispute to an
Arbitration Board. After the necessary hearing and reception of
evidence, the Board awarded nearly P50,000 to the contractor as
the price still owing him. Not satisfied with the arbitral verdict,
the owner went to the CFI (RTC), which, without receiving
any additional evidence, rendered a decision stating that the
arbitral award was proper. The owner then filed a motion for
reconsideration but failed to indicate in what way the judgment
contravened either the law or the evidence.
ISSUE: Should the verdict of the trial court be sustained?

2)

While it is true that in reciprocal obligations,
such as the contract of purchase and sale in this
case, the power to rescind is implied and any of the
contracting parties may, upon non-fulfillment by the
other party of his part of the obligation, resolve the
contract, rescission will not be permitted for a slight
or casual breach of the contract.
Rescission may be had only for such breaches
that are so substantial and fundamental as to defeat
the object of the parties in making the agreement.

Filoil Marketing Corp. v. IAC, et al.
GR 67115, Jan. 20, 1989
It is error to hold that a contract of sale is subject
to rescission on the ground of non-compliance with
one of its conditions, presumably the payment of the
purchase price, if the ground relied upon is merely
assumed and not established. In fact, as revealed in
the case at bar, it did not exist at the time of the filing
of the complaint.
2)
If there be a just cause for fixing the period within
which the debtor can comply, the court will not decree
rescission. (Art. 1191, par. 3, Civil Code) [But the
court cannot fix the term in unlawful detainer cases
where the lessee has not yet paid the rents for in the
law of lease, the court has no such discretion under
Art. 1659 of the Civil Code. (See Mina v. Rodriguez,
[CA.] O.G. Supp., Aug. 30, 1941, p. 65)]

If the property is now in the hands of an innocent
third party who has lawful possession of the same.
(Asiatic Commercial Corp. v. Ang, [CA.] 40 O.G. [11th

(d) The right to rescind needs judicial approval in certain cases,
and in others, does not need such approval.
1) Judicial approval is needed when there has already
been delivery of the object (unless of course there is

Art 1191

t

J udicial approval is NOT needed when there has been
no delivery yet (See Magdalena Estate v. Myrick, 7
Phil. 344) OR, in case there has been delivery, the
contract stipulates that either party can rescind the
same or take possession of the property upon non¬
fulfillment by the other party. ( Consing v. Jamandre,
L-27674, May 12, 1975)

Example:

I sold my car today to X for P800.000 with the
stipulation that he gives me the payment at the
Ateneo de Manila University tomorrow. If I have
not yet delivered the car to him, and he does not
come and pay tomorrow, I can consider the contract
as automatically rescinded. (Art. 1593 of the Civil
Code reads: “With respect to movable property, the
rescission of the sale shall of right take place in
the interest of the vendor, if the vendee upon the
expiration of the period fixed for the delivery of the
thing should not have appeared to receive it, or having
appeared, he should not have tendered the price
at the same time, unless a longer period has been
stipulated for payment.”) If upon the other hand, the
car has already been delivered, I cannot take the law
into my own hands and just get back the car without
a judgment in my favor. (See Ocejo Perez and Co. v.
International Bank, 37 Phil. 631) Nor am I, in the
meantime, empowered to sell to another person the
same car, without prejudice of course to the effects
of Art. 1544 of the Civil Code. (See Escueta v. Pando,
76 Phil. 256)

The right to rescind is implied (presumed) to exist and,

the contract, but the owner’s right of recourse is against
the original charterer, either for rescission or fulfillment,
with the payment of damages in either case.

Art. 1191

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The injured party who has elected fulfillment may, if
fulfillment be impossible, still ask for rescission (provided
that rescission is otherwise proper). (Art. 1191, Civil Code)
The rule is vice-versa, provided the court has not yet given
a final judgment.
(e) If an action is brought for specific performance, the damages

(d)

sought must be asked in the same action; otherwise, the
damages are deemed waived. (Daywait v. Agustinian Corp.,
39 Phil. 567)
(8) Illustrative Cases

Ramirez v. Court of Appeals, et al.
(7) Choice by the Injured Party
(a)

The injured party may choose between:
1) fulfillment (specific performance) (plus damages);
2)

or rescission (plus damages). (Art. 1191, Civil Code)

(b)

The right is alternative (Art. 1191, Civil Code) and an
alternative prayer may be made in a court complaint unless
either had been waived previously. (TS, February 6, 1912)

(c)

The right is not conjunctive, that is, the plaintiff cannot
ask for BOTH remedies. (Verceluz v. Edano, 44 Phil. 801;
and Magdalena Estate v. Myrick, 71 Phil. 344). Thus, if
the plaintiff elects fulfillment of a reciprocal obligation,
rescission thereof may not be declared at the same time.
(Bacordo v. Alcantara, L-20080, July 30, 1965) However,
in some cases, in the interest of justice partial rescission
and partial fulfillment may be allowed. (See Tan Guat v.
Pamintuan, [CA.] O.G. 2494)

However, the rule is still that the rescission or
resolution of a contract has the effect of abrogating it in
all its parts, the creditor cannot demand rescission, and
still insist on the performance of subordinate stipulations.
Hence, a clause allowing for attorney’s fees for the
foreclosure of a mortgage cannot be availed of if the
mortgage is itself rescinded. (Po Paues v. Sequenza, 47
Phil. 404)

98 Phil. 225
(Illustrating Effect of Loss in Connection with
Art. 1191)

FACTS: A and B were co-owners of a motor boat. In a
written instrument, B sold her half-share in the boat to A for
P4,500 which was to be paid in three equal installments. It was
agreed that in case of first default, A must pay interests; and
that in case of second default, B gets back her half-share in the
boat without the necessity of reimbursing A for whatever A has
already paid. After paying two installments, A defaulted in the
payment of the third installment. Subsequently, a fortuitous
event destroyed the boat. B now instituted an action to recover
what has not yet been paid (the third installment) plus 6%
interest from default. A claims, however, that the loss of the
boat by a fortuitous event has excused him from the obligation
to pay the balance.
ISSUE: Is he correct?
HELD: A must still pay. Under the contract and under
the law, B, the seller-creditor, had the right to demand specific
performance (payment) or rescission (getting back her share).
She selected specific performance (for under the contract the
first default entitled her to collect plus interest). The loss of the
boat is immaterial, for the generic obligation to pay money is
not extinguished or excused by the fortuitous loss of the boat.

47 Phil. 821
(Illustrating Effect of a Slight Breach)

FACTS: Song Fo and Co. ordered molasses from the
Hawaiian-Phil. Co. When the time for payment came, Song Fo
and Company was not yet ready to pay. It was only 20 days
afterwards that the buyer offered to pay. The seller accepted the

overdue account, and started delivering the molasses, but it later
changed its mind and wrote a letter to the buyer, cancelling the
contract. The buyer brought this action to enforce fulfillment.

HELD: The buyer wins the case for two reasons:
1)
The breach of the contract the delay of the payment
is only a slight breach, and is not substantial enough to
warrant rescission;
Granting that there was a breach, still the seller waived
2)
this by accepting the payment of the overdue account. (See
Warner, Barnes and Co. v. Inza, 4 Phil. 505)
[NOTE: In Villanueva v. Yulo, et al., L-12985, Dec.
29, 1959, the Court held that a non-substantial breach
of a contract cannot give rise to a rescission. Here, the
breach was the failure to add P8,000 to the buying price,
which amount was to be given as a bribe to the Japanese
army officers to prevent them from using the premises
in question as their headquarters during the Japanese
occupation. It turned out, however, that the Japanese did
not really intend to use said premises hence, the object
of the contract was never defeated.]

the lessor sued Natividad for specific performance and damages
on the theory that in the case of any coin-operated phonograph,
the stucking-up of the coins was a normal occurrence.

ISSUE: Will the lessor be allowed to recover?
HELD: Yes. The power to rescind must be exercised through
the courts. This, Natividad did not do. Moreover, the breach of
contract here is not substantial for the defect complained of did
not render the jukebox unsuitable or unserviceable.

(Illustrating Rights of Innocent Third Persons)

FACTS: Francisco Ang bought and received from the
plaintiff 36 cartons of Gloco Tonic upon his promise to pay that
very afternoon. Although he had not yet paid, he sold same to
Mr. Tan, an innocent purchaser for value. The plaintiff now sues
for the recovery of the cartons of Gloco Tonic from Mr. Tan.
HELD: Plaintiff cannot recover from Mr. Tan. His only right
would be to proceed against Mr. Ang, for the law subordinates
the right of rescission to the right of innocent third persons.

FACTS: A sold B a particular bar the “New Coin Cafe.”
B agreed to pay the price in installments in addition to paying a
debt which A owed C. In other words, B was supposed to pay C
A’s debt as part of the purchase price. The contract contained
two stipulations which provided:
1) That in case of non-fulfillment by either party, the contract

would be rescinded;
2)

And that in case the purchaser failed to comply with any of
the stipulations of the contract, the bar was to be returned
to the vendor without remunerating the buyer for any
improvements she may have made.

B did not comply with the stipulations of the contract. As
a matter of fact, she borrowed money from C. As a result, C
brought an action against B. Judgment was rendered against
B, and the sheriff attached the property (the bar) despite A’s
protest. The property was then sold at public auction and the
selling price was given to C. A then brought this action against
C. It was proved that:
1) The sheriff knew of the contract between A and B, and
was therefore in bad faith (for he should have notified the
court).

C did not know of said contract between A and B, and was
therefore in good faith.
ISSUE: May A recover from C? Why? If not, what is A’s
remedy?
HELD: A cannot recover the bar from C because although
it is true that the seller has the right to rescind in case the
buyer should not fulfill his or her obligations, still rescission
cannot be availed of because the property is now in the hands
of an innocent third person. A’s remedy will be to get damages
from B, and also from the sheriff, since both are in bad faith.
It cannot be said that there was automatic rescission here (for
the property had already been delivered). An affirmative judicial
action to rescind or resolve should have been brought. (See TS,
Jan. 19, 1904 and Escueta v. Pando, 42 O.G. No. 11, p. 2750,
which held that since the law says “The court shall decree the
rescission claimed ...” it follows that judicial intervention is

defaulted in the payment. Although there was no stipulation that
in case of failure to continue paying the monthly installments,
the money paid in previous installments would be forfeited in
favor of the seller, and no stipulation about rescission, still the
Estate informed Myrick that:
1) the contract would be considered already cancelled or
rescinded;
2)

thereon.
The Estate contended that:
1) the contract did not provide for rescission; and
2)

3)

1)

the rescission it had made was improper since the court
had not approved the same; and
that therefore, since it chose specific performance, the
money paid should not be returned.
HELD: The Magdalena Estate is completely wrong.
Firstly, although the contract did not provide for rescission,
this right is expressly granted by the law for all reciprocal
obligations.

Magdalena Estate v. Myrick

(Illustrating Effect of Making the Choice, Effect of

FACTS: Mr. Myrick purchased on installment two lots
from the Magdalena Estate for P8,000. After paying P2.500, he

the amount already paid would be forfeited.

After some time, Myrick instituted this suit to recover
money he had previously paid, together with legal interest

Secondly, the remedies of the estate were therefore to
rescind or to ask for specific performance. This right has
been already exercised by it when it notified the buyer of
its cancellation of the contract.
Thirdly, it cannot claim that the rescission was improper
since it was the Estate itself that made the rescission and
therefore it is now in estoppel and cannot repudiate its own
actuations.
Fourthly, the contract having been rescinded, the parties
must be restored to their original situation, insofar as
practicable, and this can be done by returning the price
paid already with interest from the date of the institution
of the action, there being no stipulation about forfeiture.

the Estate, having elected to cancel the contract, it cannot
now avail of specific performance.
[NOTE: The price would have been demandable had
specific performance been asked. One cannot cancel the
sale, and at the same time also get the price.]

Court allowed rescission without judicial authorization.]

Soledad T. Consing v. Jose T. Jamandre
L-27674, May 12, 1975
(Illustrating When Judicial Rescission
Is Unnecessary)

FACTS: In a contract between a sub-lessor (Jamandre)
and a sub-lessee (Consing), it was agreed that if Consing would
violate the contract, Jamandre would be authorized to take
possession of the leased premises even without resorting to
court action. Consing contends, however, that such stipulation is
VOID because it amounts to a renunciation of one’s day in court,
and therefore null. Besides, “this might open the floodgates to
violence which our laws seek to suppress.” Jamandre alleges,
however, that the stipulation does not provide for the use of force
in taking possession of the property, and should therefore not be
regarded as contrary to public policy. The stipulation reads: “that
in case of the failure on the part of the sub-lessee to comply with
any of the terms and conditions thereof, the sub-lessee hereby
gives an authority to the sub-lessor or to any of his authorized
representatives to take possession of the leased premises
including all its improvements thereon without compensation
to the sub-lessee and without necessity of resorting to any court
action, in which case, the sub-lessee shall be duly advised in
writing of her failure to comply with the terms and conditions
of the contract by way of reminder before the takeover.”
•

ISSUE: Is this stipulation valid?
HELD: Yes, the stipulation is valid. It is in the nature of a
resolutory condition, for upon the exercise by the sub-lessor of
his right to take possession of the leased property, the contract
is deemed terminated. This kind of contractual stipulation is
legal, there being nothing in the law prohibiting such kind of

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1191

agreement. As held in Froilan v. Pan Oriental Shipping Co.,
L-11897, Oct. 31, 1964 There is nothing in Art. 1191 of the
Civil Code or in any other legal provision that prohibits the
parties from entering into an agreement that violation of the
terms would cause cancellation thereof, even without court
intervention. In other words, it is not always necessary for the
injured party to resort to the courts for rescission of the contract.
As already held, judicial action is needed where (among other
instances) there is absence of a special provision in the contract
granting to a party the right of rescission (despite delivery of
the subject matter).

Ramos v. Blas
(CA.) 51 O.G. 1920, April 1955
(Illustrating Implied Waiver of the
Right to Rescind)

FACTS: A sold his parcel of land to B. Later, B after paying
the down payment, agreed to have the land be the security for
the balance of the price.
ISSUE: If B later cannot or does not pay, may A rescind
the contract?
HELD: No more. What he can do is to collect the balance
or foreclose the security, since his acceptance of the security
can be considered equivalent to an implied waiver of the right
to rescind.

Tan Guat v. Pamintuan
(CA) 37 O.G. 2494
(Illustrating Partial Rescission and Partial
Performance)

FACTS: A bought lumber from B for the construction of his
house. B delivered part of the lumber, which A immediately used.
When B did not deliver the rest, A was forced to get lumber from
other dealers. When B was ready to comply with the obligation
of delivering the rest, A did not pay for such balance because he
no longer needed them. B then sued A. A pleaded in defense that
it was B who should be liable to him for the incomplete delivery.
In his pleadings, A did not say, however, whether he wanted
rescission or fulfillment. A evidently did not want rescission for

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1191

then he would be obliged to return the lumber already used. A
also evidently did not want fulfillment since he really did not
need the rest of the lumber anymore.
HELD: There can be rescission regarding the undelivered
lumber; and regarding the delivered lumber, there was already
specific performance. Hence, A should pay what he still owes B
for the delivered lumber, and in turn get damages from B for
B’s failure to complete the delivery of the lumber.

Abella v. Francisco
55 Phil. 447
(Rescission When Time Is of the Essence)
FACTS: Francisco sold his land to Abella to pay off certain
obligations which fell due in the month of December, 1928. When
the time for payment came, the buyer was not ready to pay, so
the seller notarially rescinded the sale. Later when the buyer
could pay, Francisco no longer wanted to sell. In other words, the
seller desired rescission, the buyer desired specific performance.

HELD: Since time was of the essence here, the seller had
the right to rescind upon the buyer’s default. So, the seller should
win.
(9) Damages for Breach of Lease Contract

How much damages may be recovered in case a lease
contract is broken by, say, non-payment of rent when the period
has not yet expired?
ANS.: It depends upon what remedy has been resorted to
by the lessor (landlord).
a)
If he selects specific performance, he can demand the
accrued rent plus the future rent for the unexpired term.
Example: Ten years contract. The first two years rent
have not yet been paid. Lessor at the end of the two years
demands specific performance. He gets the back rents for
two years and the rents for the remaining eight years,
payable as they accrue, plus damages.
b)
If the lessor demands rescission, he gets only the back rents
and ouster of the lessee, plus damages, but not (necessarily)
the future rents or rentals for the unexpired term.

Art. 1191

Rios v. Jacinto Palma, et al,
49 Phil. 7
FACTS: A lease contract for 15 years at P400 a month was
complied with for only three years, after which the lessee did
not pay rent. The lessor asked the lessee to vacate the premises,
if he could not afford to pay. The lessee then turned over the
premises to the lessor. Now the lessor demands rent for the
remaining 12 years.
HELD: Since the lessor decided to select rescission, he is
now entitled to possession, but not to the future rents for the
unexpired term. He cannot have both remedies of rescission
and specific performance. Had the back rentals not been paid
yet, he would have been entitled to them. In the instant case,
he can collect only special damages those that resulted from
the breach, not necessarily the unexpired rents. (See Rubio de
Larena v. Villanueva, 53 Phil. 932)

v. Court of Appeals, David A. Raymundo &

A substantial breach of a reciprocal obligation, like failure
to pay the price in the manner prescribed by the contract, entitles
the injured party to rescind the obligation.
Rescission abrogates the contract from its inception and
requires a mutual restitution of benefits received.
(10) Damages in Case of Breach of Employment

Sta. Cecilia Sawmills, Inc. v. CER
L-19273 and L-19274, Feb. 29, 1964

A ruling that would permit a dismissed laborer to earn
backwages for all time or for a very long period of time is not only
unjust to the employer but the same would foster indolence on
the part of the laborers. The laborer is not supposed to be relying
on a court judgment for his support, but should do everything a
reasonable man would do; he should find employment as soon
as employment has been lost, especially when the employment
has to depend on a litigation. Indeed, he has to minimize his

loss.

(11) Instance Where Article Is Inapplicable

Suria v. IAC
GR 73893, Jan. 30, 1987

FACTS: HAC, owner of the lot in dispute, entered into
a deed of sale with mortgage with GRJ. GRJ paid only one
installment, i.e., the one due in July 1975. All the others
remained unsettled. Despite repeated demands, GRJ failed to
comply. Thereafter, HAC sued GRJ for rescission. Meanwhile,
GRJ offered to pay all outstanding balance under the Deed of
Sale with mortgage. But HAC rejected the offer. Then, GRJ
moved to dismiss on the ground that HAC is not entitled to
subsidiary remedy of rescission because of the presence of the
remedy of foreclosure. The trial court denied the motion.
The Court of Appeals sustained the trial court, saying the
grant to the vendor-mortgagee (HAC) of the right to foreclose if
the vendee-mortgagor (GRJ) fails to comply with the provisions
of the mortgage merely recognizes the right of the vendors to
foreclose and realize on the mortgage but does not preclude
them from availing of their other remedies under the law such
as rescission of contract and damages under Arts. 1191 and 1170
of the Civil Code in relation to RA 6552.

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and
ordered the vendee-mortgagor (GRJ) to pay the balance of his
indebtedness under the Deed of Sale with Mortgage with legal
interests from the second installment due in 1975 until fully
paid, failing which the vendor-mortgagee (HAC) may resort to
foreclosure.
HELD: Article 1191 on reciprocal obligations is not
applicable under the facts of this case. Moreover, Art. 1383 of the
Civil Code provides that the action for rescission is subsidiary.
It cannot be instituted except when the party suffering damage
has no other legal means to obtain reparation for the same.
The vendee-mortgagor’s (GRJ’s) breach of obligation is
not with respect to the perfected contract of sale but in the
obligations created by the mortgage contract. The remedy is
not a principal action retaliatory in character, but becomes a
subsidiary one which by law is available only in the absence of
246

Art. 1191

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

any other legal remedy. (Art. 1384, Civil Code) Foreclosure here
is not only a remedy accorded by law but is a specific provision
found in the contract between the parties. In the contract of
purchase and sale, the parties stipulated that the payment of
the price was guaranteed by the mortgage of the property sold.
This agreement has the two-fold effect of: (1) acknowledging
indisputably that the sale had been consummated, so much so
that the vendee-mortgagor was disposing of it by mortgaging
it to the vendor, and (2) of waiving the pacto comisorio,i.e., the
resolution of the sale in the event of failure to pay the purchase
price, such waiver being proved by the execution of the mortgage
to guarantee the payment, and in accord therewith the vendor’s
adequate remedy, in case of non-payment, is the foreclosure of
mortgage.

There is no cause for the resolution of the sale as prayed
for by the vendor-mortgagee. His action should have been one
for the foreclosure of the mortgage, which is not the action in
this case. Article 1191 is not applicable in this case, since the
subject matter of the sale is real property. It does not come
strictly within the provisions of Art. 1191 (Art. 1124, Spanish
Civil Code), but is rather subjected to the stipulations agreed
upon by the contracting parties and to the provisions of Art.
1592 (Art. 1504, Spanish Civil Code) of the Civil Code.

GRJ, the vendee-mortgagor, has offered to pay all past
due accounts. Considering the lower purchasing value of the
peso in terms of prices of real estate today, HAC, the vendor¬
mortgagee, is correct in stating that he has suffered losses.
However, he is also to blame for trusting persons who could not
or would not comply with their obligations on time. HAC could
have foreclosed on the mortgage immediately when it fell due
instead of waiting all these years while trying to enforce the
wrong remedy. The‘pacto comisorio’ or‘ley comisoria’ is nothing
more than a condition subsequent to the contract of purchase and
sale. Considered carefully, it is the very condition subsequent
that is always attached to all bilateral obligations according
to Art. 1191 (Art. 1124, Spanish Civil Code); except that when
applied to real property it is not within scope of said Art. 1191
(Art. 1124), and it is subordinate to the stipulations made by
the contracting parties and to the provisions of Art. 1592. (Art.
1504, Spanish Civil Code)

(12) Extrajudicial Rescission

Spouses Reynaldo Alcaraz & Esmeralda Alcaraz v.
Pedro M. Tangga-an, et al., GR 128568, April 9, 2003

FACTS: Petitioner-spouses rescinded the contract of lease
without judicial approval. Due to the change in ownership of
the land, petitioner-spouses decided to unilaterally cancel the
contract because Virgilio supposedly became the new owner of
the house after acquiring title to the lot. They alleged that there
was no reason anymore to perform their obligations as lessees
because the lesser had ceased to be the owner of the house.
HELD: There is nothing in the lease contract that allows
the parties to extrajudicially rescind the same in case of violation
of the terms thereof. Extrajudicial rescission of a contract is not
possible without an express stipulation to that effect. (Art. 1191)
What petitioner-spouses should have done was to file a special
civil action for interpleader for claimants to litigate their claims
and to deposit rentals in court.
(13) Query

Why is mutual restitutions required in cases involving
rescission under Art. 1191?

ANS.: Such restitution is necessary to bring back the
parties to their original situation prior to the inception of the
contract. (Fil-Estate Golf by Development, Inc. v. Vertex Sales
& Trading, Inc., 698 SCRA 272)
(14) Effect of an ‘Automatic Rescission Clause*

It effectively rescinds (or cancels) the contract upon breach
without need of any judicial declaration. (Province of Camarines Sur
v. Bodega Glassware, 821 SCRA 295 [2017])
Art. 1192. In case both parties have committed a breach
of the obligation, the liability of the first infractor shall be
equitably tempered by the courts. If it cannot be determined
which of the parties first violated the contract, the same shall
be deemed extinguished, and each shall bear his own damages.

Art 1193

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
Rule If Both Parties Have Committed a Breach
“The above rules are deemed just. The first one is fair to
both parties because the second infractor also derived or thought
he would derive some advantage by his own act or neglect. The
second rule is likewise just, because it is presumed that both at
about the same time tried to reap some benefit.” (Report of the
Code Commission, p. 130)

Section 2
OBLIGATIONS WITH A PERIOD
Art. 1193. Obligations for whose fulfillment a day certain
has been fixed, shall be demandable only when that day comes.
Obligations with a resolutory period take effect at once,
but terminate upon arrival of the day certain.
A day certain is understood to be that which must
necessarily come, although it may not be known when.
If the uncertainty consists in whether the day will come
or not, the obligation is conditional and it shall be regulated
by the rules of the preceding Section.

COMMENT:
(1) ‘Period’ Defined

A period is a certain length of time which determines the
effectivity or the extinguishment of obligations.
(2) Manresa’s Definition of a “Period’

“A term or a period consists in a space of time which
has an influence on obligations as a result of a judicial act,
and either suspends their demandableness, or produces their
extinguishment. ... Obligations with a period are, therefore,
those whose consequences are subjected in one way or another
to the expiration of said term.” (Manresa, Commentaries on the

it does not militate against its existence. (8 Manresa 153,

(7) Queries

“I will support you from the time X marries.” Is this an
obligation with a term or a conditional obligation?
ANS.: This is a conditional obligation because we
cannot be sure whether or not X will marry. In other words,
this is an obligation with a suspensive condition, not an
obligation with a suspensive term.
(b) "I will begin supporting you if your father dies.” Is this a
conditional obligation or an obligation with a term?

(a)

—

ANS.: This is an obligation with a term ex die a term
with a suspensive effect. Even if the word “if was used,
still there is no doubt that “your father” will die, sooner or
later.

Art 1193

“I will begin supporting you from the time your father dies
of malaria." Is this an obligation with a term?
ANS.: This is an obligation with a suspensive
condition. It is true that “your father" will die sooner or
later, BUT we are not sure whether or not he will die of
malaria. Hence, we have here a condition instead of a term.
(d) “I will pay you my debt when my means permit me to do
so.” Is this an obligation with a condition or an obligation
with a term?
ANS.: This is considered by the law as an obligation
with a term. “When the debtor binds himself to pay when
his means permit him to do so, the obligation shall be
deemed to be one with a period, subject to the provisions
of Art. 1197.” (Art. 1180, Civil Code)

to be paid out of the first proceeds from a transhipment
of the ore. The court held that said transhipment is a
suspensive term (not a suspensive condition) because
whether or not there could be a transhipment, the balance
still owing had to be paid. The stipulation on transhipment
was intended merely to fix the future date of the payment.]

Lirag Textile Mills, Inc. and Felix K. Lirag
v. Court of Appeals and Cris tan Alcantara
L-30736, July 11, 1975

FACTS: Alcantara was persuaded by Felix Lirag of the
Lirag Textile Mills to give up a permanent job and to join Lirag
in the latter’s business until such period as when Alcantara
would voluntarily resign or until Alcantara is removed for a
valid cause. Sometime later, Alcantara was removed on account
of financial reverses on the part of the Company (a ground which
proved, however, to be false).
ISSUE: In an action by Alcantara for damages, would the
provisions of RA 1052 as amended (the Termination Pay Law
when there is no time fixed for employment) apply such that all
that Alcantara will receive is a small sum based on the number
of years he has been employed by the Company?

HELD: RA 1052 as amended, will not apply, because in the
present case there is an express agreement as to the period of
Alcantara’s employment, that period to start from Alcantara’s
employment up to the time Alcantara may voluntarily resign, or
when the employer removes Alcantara for a valid cause. Thus,
the employment has a period subject only to the resolutory
condition of resignation or removal for cause. RA 1052 as
amended by RA 1787, does not apply. The employer, having
terminated Alcantara’s employment without a valid cause,
committed a breach of contract making it liable for damages.

Compania General de Tabacos v. Anoza
7 Phil. 455
FACTS: A was indebted to B. The debt was supposed to
be paid in installments. There was no provision in the contract
by which upon failure of one installment of the debt, the whole
debt should thereupon become at once payable. A was unable
to pay one installment on time. B brought an action not only to
recover said installment but the entire debt.

ISSUE: How much can B recover?
HELD: B can recover only the installment due. The
balance is not yet demandable, and will become so only at the
time stipulated by the parties. This is because there was no

Berg v. Magdalena Estate, Inc.
92 Phil. 110

The clause “until the defendant shall have obtained a loan
from the National City Bank of New York, or after it has obtained
funds from other sources” should be considered a condition (and
not a term), for the obtaining of funds may or may not happen.
(As a matter of fact, here the loan never materialized.)

Santos v. Court of Appeals
L-60210, March 27, 1984
A lease on a “month to month basis” is one with a definite
term, and is, therefore, not governed by PD 20 or BP 25 (following
the RANTAEL case). (See Rantael v. Have, 97 SCRA 453)

J. Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera
(concurring and dissenting)
The mere fact that payment of rent is made every month
does not follow that the lease is really on a “month to month

basis” (otherwise, there will hardly be any occasion where PD 29

or BP 25 can be applied). For the two laws to apply, there must
really be an agreement that the lease is from month to month.
Where there is no “monthly basis," PD 20 and BP 25 can apply,
even if the rent is paid monthly.
Balucanag v. Judge Francisco
GR 33422, May 30, 1983
If the rent agreed upon is payable on a monthly basis,
the duration of the lease is deemed from month to month, and
the lessor is allowed to terminate the lease after each month,
provided there is due notice. After such notice, the lessee’s right
to continue in possession ceases, and an action of unlawful
detainer may be brought against him.

Ace-Agro Development Corp. v. Court of Appeals
GR 119729, Jan. 21, 1997
78 SCAD 146
ISSUE: Because the suspension of work under a contract
has been brought about by force majeure, is the period during
which work has been suspended justify an extension of the term
of the contract?

HELD: No. The fact that the contract is subject to a
resolutory period, which relieves the parties of their respective
obligations, does not stop the running of the period of their

contract.

(a)

It must refer to the future.

(b)

It must be certain (sure to come) but can be extended.

It must be physical and legally possible, otherwise the
obligation is void. (.Example: “I’ll give you my house one

(14) The Moratorium Laws of the Philippines

Shortly after liberation, we had our so-called Moratorium
Laws. (EO 25, 32 [1945] and RA 342 [1948]) The purpose of a
moratorium is to obtain a postponement of the period within
which to pay off obligations. It is a suspension of payment, an
act of grace. In the case of Rutter v. Esteban, 93 Phil. 68, the
Moratorium Laws were declared (in 1953) as unconstitutional
because:

the period stated in the law is indefinite;
(b) and the continuation of the moratorium will be unreasonable
and oppressive to creditors, inasmuch as, considering the
period that has elapsed since liberation, the debtors may

Period

(a)

A was supposed to pay B Pl,000,000 on Dec. 31, 2005. But
believing that the obligation was due and demandable
already on Dec. 31, 2004, A paid B the Pl ,000,000 on said
date. How much may A recover from B, say on June 30,

ANS.: A may recover from B on June 30, 2005, the

plus of course interest at the legal rate from Jan. 1, 2005

ANS.: There should be no returning for two reasons:
It is true that March 31 was the date set for payment

from March 31 to March 15.
Even if there had been no change in the date agreed
upon, still it must be remembered that the problem
here is one where we are dealing not with two
unilateral obligations. And we already know that

in reciprocal obligations, pending the fulfillment
of the condition (and, therefore, also pending the
termination of the period) the interests and fruits
are deemed to compensate each other, when there
has been premature performance on both sides. (Art.

COMMENT:

2)

(1) For Whose Benefit the Term Has Been Established

General Rule
Term is for the benefit of debtor or creditor. (Meaning: The
debtor cannot pay prematurely and the creditor cannot demand
prematurely.)
[NOTE: This Article applies only where the parties to a
contract themselves have fixed a period, and not to a case where
the parties have authorized the Court to fix a reasonable term.
(Orit v. Balrodgan Co., Ltd., L-12277, Dec. 29, 1959)]
(2) Exceptions (if there be such intent)
(a)

(b)

Term is for the benefit of debtor alone. [Meaning: He is
required to pay only at the end, but he may pay even before.
Example: D will pay C “within 6 years.” Here D can
pay even after one week from the time the obligation was
contracted. (See Sia v. Court of Appeals, 48 O.G. 5259) D
may also resist premature demand for compliance. (See
Samson v. Andal de Aguila, L-5932, Feb. 25, 1954)]
Term is for the benefit of the creditor alone. (Meaning:
Creditor can demand at any time even before the term
expires, and he cannot be compelled to accept payment
from the debtor prior to the stipulated period.
Example: D promised to pay on Dec. 1, 2005, with
the creditor given the right to demand performance even
before said date.)

(3) Circumstances Which Indicate for Whom the Benefit of

the Term Is
(a)

For the benefit of both
1)
When there is interest stipulated (Here the creditor
is interested in the term because of the interests that
would be earned; the debtor is interested because
he is given enough time to pay). (See Sarmiento V.
Villasenor, 43 Phil. 880)
260

Art. 1196

When the creditor is interested in keeping his money
safely invested (thus making the debtor a sort of
depository), or when the creditor wants to protect
himself from the dangers of currency depreciation.

Nicolas, et al. v. Matias, et al.
89 Phil. 126
FACTS: During the Japanese occupation (June 29, 1944),
D borrowed P30,000 from C in Japanese currency at 6% inter¬
est per annum. Maturity on any day “within the 6th year”
(not within six years, but during the 6th year); in other words,
between June 30, 1949 and June 29, 1950. On July 15, 1944,
D wanted to pay the whole amount, and even offered to pay in¬
terest for five years. (Evidently, D was aware of the decreasing
purchasing value of the peso at that time).
ISSUE: Can C be compelled to accept?

—

HELD: No, C cannot be compelled to accept. Here, the
benefit of the term is for both D and C
for D, because he
could use the money for at least five years; and C, because C
had wisely calculated that after five years, the chances were
that the Japanese as well as the Japanese currency would no
longer be in the Philippines. Moreover, for C to accept five years’
interest would be for him to violate the Usury Law, which allows
payment of advance interest for only one year.
(b) For the benefit of the debtor
1)
When the loan is without interest, this is generally
only for the benefit of the debtor.
[NOTE: This rule, however, is NOT absolute,
for even if the creditor receives no interest, still he
may have entered into the contract to protect himself
against the sudden decline in the purchasing power
of the currency. (Aguilar v. Miranda, L-16510, Nov.
29, 1961)]
2)
When payment is to be made "within" a certain period
from date of contract. (See Samson v. Aguila, supra)

—

(c)

For the benefit of the creditor
[Usually, this only exists if there is a stipulation to
this effect, as when the contract provides that no payment
261

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1196

should be made till after a certain given period. (See Ochoa
v. Lopez, [CA.] 50 O.G. 5871, Dec. 1954) Acceptance of
partial payment even before the expiration of the period
means a waiver on the part of the creditor of his right to
refuse payment before the end of said period. (Lopez v.
Ochoa, L-7955, May 30, 1958)]
(4) Some Decided Cases

Sarmiento v. Villasefior
43 Phil. 880

FACTS: A borrowed money from B, and pledged a medal
with diamonds as security. It was agreed that A was to pay the
money loaned with interest at the end of one year.
ISSUE: Before the expiration of the one-year period, is A
allowed to pay his debt and recover the medal pledged?
HELD: No, unless B consents, for the one-year period was
established for the benefit of both.

Illusorio and Vida v. Busuego
L-822, 1949

FACTS: A borrowed P35.000 from B with interest of 8%
per annum. As security, A mortgaged several parcels of land in
favor of B. The contract provided that the debt would be payable
within a period of three years, BUT the mortgagor would not be
allowed to pay the debt before said time UNLESS the mortgagee
B should consent. The contract was entered into in 1943. Later,
A sold the lands to C. C assumed A’s obligation toward B. In
1944, C was paying B the whole debt, with three years interest,
butB refused. Thereupon, C deposited the money in court and
both A and C filed an action to compel B to accept the payment.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1196

ISSUE: May C pay B the whole debt even before the
expiration of three years and without the consent of B, provided
that C would pay the interest for the whole three years?

HELD: No. Of course, the obligation could be paid within
three years, but the contract required B’s consent if the payment
was to be made before the end of three years. Since B did not
consent, it is clear that C cannot yet pay. Both conditions must
be given effect. (.Dissenting: Yes. It is true that B’s consent is
required if premature payment is to be made but evidently, the
only purpose of this was to make sure that the interest for three
years would be paid; otherwise, there would be the danger that
the debtor would pay prematurely and give a lesser amount
of interest. Since this fear has been eliminated by the offer to
pay interest for the whole three years, there is no reason why
B should not now accept. In this way, both conditions of the
contract are being given effect. The majority disregards the first
condition, and gives effect only to the second.)
Ochoa v. Lopez
(CJL) 50 O.G. 5871, Dec. 1954

FACTS: D borrowed from C a sum of money secured by a
mortgage. The contract stipulated that the debtor D would not
be allowed to pay till after the end of two years from the date the
contract was perfected. Before the end of the two years, however,
D offered to pay partially, and C accepted the partial payment.
ISS UE: What is the effect of Cs acceptance of the premature
partial payment?

HELD: While at the beginning it was clear that the creditor

had the benefit of the term, his acceptance of the premature
partial payment implies his renunciation of the benefit of the
term. He had the right to refuse, but he did not.

Nepomuceno v. Narciso, et al.
84 Phil. 542
FACTS: A stipulation in a contract of mortgage provided
that the mortgagor should not pay off the mortgage while the
war (World War II) was going on.

HELD: Yes, because it is neither contrary to law nor to

(5) When Prescriptive Period Begins

Under the New Civil Code, an action upon a written
contract (of loan, for example) must be brought within ten
years from the time the right of action accrues. (Art. 1144) In
obligations with the benefit of the term given to both debtor and
creditor, the right of action accrues from the end of the stipulated
period, because it is only from that time that the obligation really
becomes enforceable. (See Sarmiento v. Villasenor, 43 Phil. 880)
Art. 1 197. If the obligation does not fix a period, but from
its nature and the circumstances it can be inferred that a
period was intended, the courts may fix the duration thereof.
The courts shall also fix the duration of the period when
it depends upon the will of the debtor.
In every case the courts shall determine such period
as may under the circumstances have been probably
contemplated by the parties. Once fixed by the courts, the
period cannot be changed by them.

any work thereon, he has lost whatever right he originally
had to have the period fixed under Art. 1197. (Chaves v.
Gonzales, L-27454, April 30, 1970) Here, the owner of the
machine had it repaired by someone else. The Court ruled
that the original repairman can be required to pay the
person who actually made the needed repairs. The Court
applied Art. 1167. (Ibid.)

(d)

When specific periods are provided for in the law, as in an
employment contract where if no period was agreed upon,
the time of employment depends upon the time for payment
of salary.

Gregorio Araneta, Inc. v. Phil. Sugar Estates
Development Co.
L-22558, May 31, 1967

FACTS: In a contract of sale, it was agreed that the
buyer would build on a parcel of land the Santo Domingo
Church and convent, while the seller would construct street
bordering the lot. The seller failed to finish the construction
of the street on one side because some squatters thereon
refused to vacate. The church was eventually finished. In
1958, the buyer brought the instant case against the seller
to compel him to comply with his obligation, and to pay
damages. The defense was that the obligation, to construct
the street, was with a period, hence, the complaint was
premature, as the buyer must first ask the court to fix the
period. Incidentally, the presence of the squatters was
known to the parties at the time the contract was entered
into. Moreover, there was a pending case against said

squatters.

ISSUE: Does the Court still have to fix the period?
HELD: Yes, in view of the knowledge of both parties
of the presence of the squatters. Because of this knowledge,
the parties must have intended to defer performance until
the squatters shall have been duly evicted. The term fixed
by the court was clearly just “until all the squatters are
finally evicted.”
(2) When the Court May Not Fix the Term
(a)

When no term was specified by the parties because no term
was even intended, in which case the obligation is really a
pure one, and demandable at once, unless of course absurd

Art. 1197

Example:

Barretto v. Santa Marina
26 Phil. 440

FACTS: A was employed by B as manager of a cigar
and cigarette factory, the “La Insular.” B obligated himself
to use A’s services so long as A did not show discouragement
in his work. Later A was discharged. A complained that
B should have first brought an action to fix the duration
of the period here, and since B did not, A now desires to
obtain damages.
HELD: This is not an obligation with an intention to
grant the debtor a term, because this case is governed by
the specific provisions regarding agency.
[NOTE: The employment of a person who has worked
for a very long time, say from 1931 to the time of his
separation in 1962, cannot be deemed to be one without a
definite period; in other words, his employment should be
considered as one with a period, and therefore he cannot
be dismissed without just cause under the Termination

Industrial Relations, L-34300, Nov. 22, 1974)]
[NOTE: Employees, even with fixed terms, can
ordinarily be dismissed for acts inimical to the interests of
the employer. For instance, the following acts of security
guards are, among others, just causes for dismissal:
challenging superior officers, insubordination, sleeping on
the posts, dereliction of duty. (Luzon Stevedoring Corp. v.
CIR, L-17411, 18681, 18683, Dec. 31, 1965)}

Nicanor M. Baltazar v. San Miguel Brewery
L-23076, Feb. 27, 1969

FACTS: Baltazar was a salesman in charge of the
Dagupan warehouse of the San Miguel Brewery. His
employment was without a definite period. Because of
48 days of absence without permission or proper reason,
Baltazar was dismissed by the Company for what was
admittedly a just cause.
ISSUE: Now then, is he entitled to the one-month
(mesada) separation pay provided for in RA 1052 as
amended?
HELD-. No, because his dismissal was for a just cause.
It is well-settled in this jurisdiction that if the dismissal
is for a just cause, a person without a definite term of
employment is not entitled to one month notice or in lieu
thereof to one month salary. If an employee hired for a
definite period can be dismissed for a just cause without
the need of paying him a month’s salary, an employee hired
without a definite tenure should not be allowed to enjoy
better rights.
(e) When what appears to be a term is really a condition (such
as when a debt is payable only after the debtor’s estate’s
other debts have been paid, for this does not depend upon
the exclusive will of the debtor). (See Martin v. Boyero, 55
Phil. 760)
(f) When the period within which to ask the Court to have
the period fixed has itself already prescribed. (Calero v.
Carrion, et al., L-13246, March 30, 1960)
268

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1197

(3) Applicability of the Article to the Obligations Contem¬

plated Therein

Article 1197 should be considered as part and parcel
(or automatically incorporated) in all obligations which are

contemplated therein. Thus, for example, if the obligation
intends to grant a term but the term has not been fixed, the
Court will be authorized to do so. Please note that if the Court,
pursuant to the Article, actually fixes the term, the Court does
not amend or modify the obligation. The Court merely enforces
or carries out an implied stipulation in the contract. (Deudor v.
J.M. Tuason and Co., Inc., L13768, May 30, 1961)
(4) The Action to Bring under This Article

The only action which the creditor can bring upon an
obligation that does not fix a term, but where a term was indeed
intended, is to ask the court to fix the period within which the
debtor must pay for the simple reason that the fulfillment of the
obligation itself cannot be demanded until after the court has
fixed the period for its compliance. (Vda. de Ungson v. Lopez,
[CA.] GR L-10180 R, March 10, 1954, 50 O.G. 4298) The Court
may fix the period, even if this has not been specifically asked,
so long as the prayer, for example, asks for “such other and
further relief as to the court may appear just and equitable.”
(Paul Schenker v. William F. Gemperle, L-16499, Aug. 31, 1962)
And ordinarily specific performance cannot be demanded at the
same time that the court is asked to fix the period (Concepcion v.
People, 74 Phil. 62, decided, Aug. 1943), such action for specific
performance being premature. (Eleizegui v. Lawn Tennis Club, 2
Phil. 309) In a case, however, the Supreme Court has ruled that
in exceptional instances, as when a prior and separate action
would be a mere formality and serve no other purpose but delay,
there is no necessity of such prior action. (Tiglao, et al. v. MRR
Co., infra)

Illustrations:
Tiglao, et al. v. Manila Railroad Co.
98 Phil. 181
FACTS: The Manila Railroad Co. paid its employees a
part of the latter’s salary differentials and promised to pay the
269

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1197

balance after “funds for the purpose would be available.” This
was an action by the employees to recover said balance. One
point raised by the company was that a separate action was first
necessary to fix the duration of the term within which it would
be required to pay.
HELD: Since the time for payment here really depended on
the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, this may
be considered as an obligation with a term whose duration has
been left to the will of the debtor, so that pursuant to the law,
the duration of the term should be fixed by the court. Although
the general rule is to first bring a separate action for the express
purpose, still as in this case, if this point has been raised and
discussed in the pleadings the court has power already to fix
the term, without the necessity of instituting a separate action
precisely for that purpose, such prior and separate action being
a mere formality in this case, and serving no other purpose but
delay. The term of one year set by the lower court was thus
affirmed by the Supreme Court.
[NOTE: It would seem here that the bringing of the case
payment is premature, since the right to demand
compel
to
compliance accrues only at the termination of the one-year period
fixed. It is as if I am bound to pay X Pl,000 at the end of three
years. Obviously, the case can be dismissed for the cause has
not yet accrued.]
[NOTE: In the case of Pages v. Basilan Lumber Co.,
L-10679, Nov. 29, 1958, the Supreme Court held that when a
would-be purchaser has not been given a definite time limit as
to when he should make the purchase, he is not in default even
if the would-be seller makes a demand. What the latter must
do first should be to ask that the court fix the term. (See Server
v. Eisenberg & Co., L-10741, March 29, 1958)]

Epifanio Alano, et al. v. Claro Cortes, et al.
L-15276, Nov. 28, 1960

FACTS: The litigants in a certain civil case entered into a
judicial compromise whereby Alano, who owed Cortes a sum of
money, would pay Cortes P131,000, and Cortes would in turn
convey to him a certain parcel of land. The Court ordered the
parties to comply with their respective obligations. Because

Art 1197

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Alano failed to pay, Cortes filed a motion in the same case asking
the court to fix a date on which the obligation of Alano should
be paid. The Court then fixed a period of 30 days within which
the plaintiff should pay. The Court also wrote in its order a
forfeiture clause, by virtue of which the right of Alano over the
property would be forfeited in case of failure to pay within said
30 days.
ISSUE: Is the judicial order valid?
HELD: Yes, because it was a step necessary to give
force and effect to its decision. The judgment being based on
a compromise, it was immediately executory, and the court,
in fixing the period, merely implemented its decision. It is
preposterous to presume that no period was intended by the
parties, and that they intended to leave the performance of their
undertaking to the whim of either party, thereby frustrating
the very purpose of the agreement. The forfeiture clause is also
justified under the Rules of Court which says that when after
judgment has become final, facts and circumstances transpire
which render the execution of a judgment impossible or unjust,
the interested party may ask the Court to modify or alter the
judgment to harmonize the same with justice and with the facts.
(5) Query: Within What Period Must the Action to Fix the

Period Be Brought?
ANS.: Within the proper prescriptive period for specific
performance if a period had been originally fixed, but to be
counted from the perfection of the contract. This is because
the right exists by operation of law from the moment of such
agreement. Extrajudicial demand is not therefore essential
for the creation of the cause of action to have the period fixed.
(Calero v. Carrion, et al., L-13246, March 30, 1960)
[NOTE: In this case, the court said that the prescriptive
period is ten years.]
Example: D wrote a promissory note in Cs favor promising
payment “little by little.” Within ten years from the date the
written contract was perfected, C must bring the action to fix
the term. If the period lapses, the right to have the court fix the
term is considered to have prescribed. (See Gonzales v. Jose, 66
Phil. 369)
271

270

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1198

(6) How the Court Fixes the Period

The Court determines the period by considering the time
probably contemplated by the parties. (Art. 1197) Once the period
is fixed by the courts, the period becomes part of the contract
thus the courts cannot change it. (Ibid.) The same is true if
the period is fixed in a compromise agreement approved by the
Court. This is because the compromise agreement acquires the
same force and effect as the decision. (Deudor v. J.M. Tuason
& Co., Inc., L-13768, May 30, 1961) The parties may of course
change the period by mutual agreement, or may even disregard
the same (See Barretto v. City of Manila, 11 Phil. 624) in which
case, the obligation becomes a pure one, and demandable at
once. (See Art. 1197)
(7) An Example Where the Article Is Not Applicable

Millare v. Hernando
GR 55480, June 30, 1987
This Article does not apply to a contract of lease which
fixes a period, e.g., an original period of five years, which has
expired, and where the parties reserved to themselves the faculty
of agreeing upon the period of the renewal contract. It does not
also apply if the duration of the renewal period is not left to the
will of the lessee alone, but rather to the will of the lessor and
the lessee. Article 1197 applies only where a contract of lease
clearly exists. If the contract is not renewed at all, there could
be no contract the period of which could be fixed.

Art. 1198. The debtor shall lose every right to make use
of the period:
(1) When after the obligation has been contracted, he
becomes insolvent, unless he gives a guaranty or security for
the debt;
(2) When he does not furnish to the creditor the
guaranties or securities which he has promised;

(3) When by his own acts he has impaired said guaranties
or securities after their establishment, and when through a
fortuitous event they disappear, unless he immediately gives
new ones equally satisfactory;

Art. 1198

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(4)

When the debtor violates any undertaking, in

consideration of which the creditor agreed to the period;
(5)

When the debtor attempts to abscond.

COMMENT:
(1) When the Debtor Loses the Benefit of the Period

Meaning of “the debtor shall lose every right to make use
of the period" the term is extinguished, and the obligation is
demandable at once.

—

(2) Examples
(a)

Of Par. 1: D owes C Pl,000,000 demandable on July 3,
2008. In December, 2004, D became insolvent. The debt is
immediately demandable in December, 2004 unless D can
offer sufficient security.

[NOTE: The insolvency referred to does not have to
be judicially declared; it is sufficient for him to find a hard
time paying off his obligations because of financial reverses
that have made his assets less than his liabilities.]
[NOTE: If there happens to be a moratorium law, the
debtor who happens to be insolvent can still take advantage
of said moratorium, which is really a term or an extension
of a period, because a moratorium is precisely made to aid
those who are insolvent.(See Timbol v. Martin, GR L-3469,
April 20, 1951)]
(b) Of Par. 2: If a debtor instead of making a mortgage in favor
of the creditor, makes it in favor of another person, he
fails to furnish the promised guaranties, and he therefore
loses the benefit of the term. (Daguhoy Enterprises, Inc. v.
Ponce, et al., 96 Phil. 15) The same thing is true if instead
of mortgaging to the creditor three parcels of land, he
mortgages only two of them. (Laplana v. Garchitorena, 48
Phil. 163)
(c) Of Par. 3: If a mortgaged house is allowed to decay by
the mortgagor, he impairs the value of the guaranty, and
therefore the debt becomes demandable immediately. In
the same way, if a mortgaged house is completely lost
(disappears) in a typhoon, the debt is due at once unless

273

272

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1198

another mortgage equally good is constituted. This is true
even if the loss be through a fortuitous event.
Song Fo and Co. v. Oria
33 Phil. 3

FACTS: Song Fo and Co. sold a launch to the defendant
Manuel Oria for P16,000 payable in quarterly installments
of Pl,000 each. The launch was made security for the debt.
Shortly after delivery to Oria, it was shipwrecked in a
storm.
ISSUE: Should the buyer still pay? If so, when?
HELD: Yes, he must still pay, since the loss of
the money (a generic thing) has not been extinguished.
Moreover, the whole balance becomes due immediately
because the security has disappeared even though through
a force majeure, unless he can substitute equally good
securities. Hence, the seller can now collect the entire
balance.
(d)

Of Par. 4: If a condition, such as not to gamble anymore,
is violated, any term given because of the condition is
lost. If an employee commits a substantial breach of his
employment contract, the employer may terminate the
employment, even if there was a fixed duration for the job.
(Marcaida v. Phil. Educ. Co., L-9960, May 29, 1957 and
Gonzales v. Haleerer, 47 Phil. 380) This paragraph was
applied by the court in Corpus v. Alikpala, L-23707, Jan.

17, 1968.)
(e)

Of Par. 5: An attempt by the debtor to escape is a sign of
bad faith, hence, the loss of the term. Note that it is not
essential that there be an actual absconding, the intent to
do so being sufficient. Upon the other hand, a mere physical
leaving, with no intent to defraud, is not sufficient.

(3) How Terms or Periods Are Computed

“When the laws speak of years, months, days or nights, it
shall be understood that

—

—

(a)

years

(b)

months

are of three hundred sixty-five days each;

—

(c)

(d)

Art. 1198

of twenty-four hours;

—

from sunset to sunrise.”

“If months are designated by their name, they shall be
computed by the number of days which they respectively have.”

“In computing a period, the first day shall be excluded and
the last day included.” (Art. 13, Civil Code)

“In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by
these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute,
the day of the act or event from which the designated period of
time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance
included. If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on
a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the
court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day.”
(Sec. 1, Rule 22, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure)
“Where the instrument is payable at a fixed period after
date, after sight, or after the happening of a specified event, the
time of payment is determined by excluding the day from which
time is to begin to run, and by including the day of payment.”
(Sec. 85, Negotiable Instruments Law)
[NOTE: If a contract stipulated that no payment shall be
made until after one year from the date of ratification of the
Treaty of Peace concluding the Greater East Asia War, but the
debt shall be fully paid within a period of three years counted
from the expiration of the aforementioned one year after the
ratification of the treaty, the obligation becomes due four years
from April 28, 1952, when a majority of the states signatory
to the Treaty of Peace ratified the same, or on April 29, 1956.
The periods fixed in the contract cannot be counted from the
ratification by the Philippines of the treaty, because the term
“ratification” is used in a general sense without any reference
to any specific country; neither should it be counted from the
factual termination of the war on Sept. 2, 1945 by the signing
of the treaty of surrender of Japan in Tokyo Bay, because the
contract expressly mentions “ratification” of the Treaty of Peace
concluding the war. (Arellano v. Tinio de Domingo, L-8679,July

(4) Some Cases

Modesto Soriano v. Carolina Abalos, et al.
84 Phil. 206

FACTS: On March 17, 1938, Juliana Abalos and Carolina
Abalos sold a parcel of land to Felipe Maneclang and Modesto
Soriano at the price of P750, with option to repurchase the
same, “at anytime they have the money.” Offer to repurchase
was made in Dec. 1941, but this could not be carried out because
of the war. Maneclang, in the meantime, ceded all his rights to
Soriano. In May, 1944, offer to repurchase was again made, but
Soriano rejected the offer. Because of this, the vendors (Abalos)
consigned (deposited) the price of P750 with the court and filed
a complaint for repurchase. Soriano refused to accept because
according to him there was no express agreement as to the time
within which the repurchase could be made and according to the
Civil Code, if no time for repurchase is stipulated, only a period
of four years is allowed.

ISS UE: Does the phrase “at any time they have the money”
expressly stipulate a time or not?
HELD: The stipulation in the contract provides that the
vendors may repurchase the property “at anytime they have the
money.” There is, therefore, a time which is expressly stipulated.
And this is “anytime.” Hence, the period of four years mentioned
in the Civil Code for redemption is not applicable. Instead,
we apply another provision of the Code which says that if the
time given is unlimited or indefinite, the time for redemption
cannot exceed ten years. The court cited the following cases to
support this contention: Heirs of Jumero v. Lizares (31 Phil.
112); Bandong, et al. v. Austria, GR 31479, and Lino Gonzaga
v. Juan Co, GR 47061. Since, therefore, offer to repurchase was
made validly in May, 1944, there is no question that redemption
can be allowed.

Jose L. Gomez, et al. v. Miguel Tabia
84 Phil. 269
FACTS: A sold B a parcel of land for P5,000 in Japanese
money, on June 24, 1944. In the contract it was agreed that
within 30 days after the expiration of one year from June 24,
1944, the aforementioned land may be redeemed or repurchased
276

Art. 1199

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

*sa ganito ding halaga" (at the same price), and that if this was
not done, B would be the absolute owner of said land. Before
the expiration of the period but after liberation, A has given B
P500, Philippine currency, but B refused, saying that he would
accept P5,000, Philippine currency. Both the trial court and
the Court of Appeals gave an equivalent value to the P5,000
Japanese money in Philippine currency. B appealed the case to
the Supreme Court asking in Philippine currency the price for
the redemption.
ISSUE: What does the phrase “sa ganito ding halaga’
means? Should it be P5,000, Japanese money (around P780.26
according to the Ballantyne scale which has been adopted for
equivalents)?
HELD: The meaning of the phrase is P5,000, Philippine
currency (and not merely its equivalent), because both parties
here speculated on the date of the termination of the war and
the liberation of the Philippines, and this kind of contract
aleatory is allowed.

“A will give B this car or this ring or this fountain pen."
A does not have to give B all the three things enumerated. The
giving of one is sufficient to satisfy the obligation.
(3) Query

In the example given above, may A compel B to accept
half the car and half the ring (hence, establishing co-ownership
between A and B)?
ANS.: No, B cannot be forced to accept. The creditor
cannot be compelled to receive part of one and part of the other
undertaking.
Art. 1200. The right of choice belongs to the debtor, unless
it has been expressly granted to the creditor.
The debtor shall have no right to choose those prestations

COMMENT:
(1) Who Has the Right of Choice
As a general rule, the right belongs to the debtor. By way
of exception it may belong to the creditor when such right has
expressly been granted to him.
(2) Example

A is obliged to give B this car or this ring or this cigarette
case. Nothing is said in the contract as to who was given the
right of choice. Suppose B selects the car, is A bound by the
choice made?
ANS.: No, A is not bound by the choice made because it is
not B but A who, in the absence of any stipulation, is given the
right to choose the object he desires to give.

In an alternative obligation, however, the general rule is that

(4) Some Cases

Agoncillo v. Javier
30 Phil. 124
FACTS: A borrowed money from B. It was agreed that at
the maturity of the debt, A will give B either the sum lent or a
particular house and lot.
ISSUE: Is this stipulation valid?
HELD: Yes, this stipulation is valid because it is simply
an alternative obligation, which is expressly allowed by the
law. The agreement to convey the house and lot at an appraised
valuation in the event of failure to pay the debt in money at its
maturity is, however, in our opinion perfectly valid. It is simply
an undertaking that if the debt is not paid in money, it will be
paid in another way. As the contract reads, the agreement is not
open to the objection that the stipulation is a pacto commisorio.
It is not an attempt to permit the creditor to declare a forfeiture
of the security upon the failure of the debtor to pay the debt at
maturity. It is simply provided that if the debt is not paid in
money it shall be paid in another specific way by the transfer
of the property at a valuation. Of course, such an agreement
unrecorded, creates no right in rem, but as between the parties,
it is perfectly valid, and specific performance by its terms may
be enforced unless prevented by the creation of superior rights
in favor of third persons.
The contract now under consideration is not susceptible
of the interpretation that the title to the house and lot in
question was to be transferred to the creditor ipso facto upon
the mere failure of the debtors to pay the debt at its maturity.
The obligations assumed by the debtors were in the alternative,
and they had the right to elect which they would perform. The
conduct of the parties show that it was not their understanding
that the right to discharge the obligation by the payment of
money was lost to the debtors by their failure to pay the debt
279

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1200

at its maturity. The plaintiff (B) accepted a partial payment
from Anastacio Alano (A) in 1908, several years after the debt
matured. The prayer of the complaint is to execute a conveyance
of the house and lot after its appraisal, unless the defendants
pay the plaintiff the debt which is the subject of this action.
It is quite clear, therefore, that under the terms of the
contract, as we read it, and the parties themselves have
interpreted it, the liability of the defendant as to the conveyance
of the house and lot is subsidiary and conditional, being
dependent upon their failure to pay the debt in money. It must
follow, therefore, that if the action to recover the debt was
prescribed, the action to compel a conveyance of the house and
lot is likewise barred, as the agreement to make such conveyance
was not an independent principal undertaking, but merely a
subsidiary alternative pact relating to the methods by which
the debt might be paid.
Ong Guan Can and Bank of the Phi). Islands
v. Century Insurance Company
46 Phil. 592

FACTS: A insured his house with B, an insurance company.
The contract stated that if the house is damaged or destroyed,
B may either pay for the damage or have the house rebuilt in a
sufficient manner.
ISSUE: Is this an alternative obligation?
HELD: Yes. “It operates to make the obligation of the
insurance company an alternative one, that is to say, that it
may either pay the amount in which the house was insured or
rebuild it.”
Equitable Insurance Casualty Co., Inc.
v. Rural Insurance and Surety Co., Inc.
L-17436, Jan. 31, 1962
The term “facultative” (or “alternative”) used in reinsurance
contracts, merely defines the right of the reinsurer (one who
insures an insurer against loss) to accept or not to accept
participation of others in the risk insured. Such a facultative
reinsurance contract is not the facultative or alternative
obligation referred to in the Civil Code.

Art. 1201

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

[NOTE: Thus, in a facultative reinsurance, the choice is to
accept or refuse-, in a facultative or alternative obligation, there
is an obligation and the choice is limited to how that obligation
may be complied with.]

The debtor shall have no right to choose those prestations

which are:
(a) impossible
(b) unlawful
(c) or which could not have been the object of the
obligation. (Art. 1200, par. 2, Civil Code)
(6) Example

A is bound to give B a pack of shabu, or a bottle of milk
taken from a goat, or a particular cigarette case, or a particular
fountain pen. A cannot choose the first, because this would be
unlawful; nor the second, because this is impossible. A can,
therefore, choose only between the third and the fourth.
Art. 1201. The choice shall produce no effect except from
the time it has been communicated.

COMMENT:
(1) Means of Notification or Communication to Other Party
of Choice
Since the law requires no specific form, it is believed the
choice can be communicated orally or in writing, expressly, or
impliedly, such as by performance of one of the obligations. ( See
8 Manresa 181)
(2) Effect of Notice That Choice Has Been Made

Once notice has been made that a choice has been done, the
obligation becomes a simple obligation to do or deliver the object
selected. (8 Manresa 181) An election once made is binding on
the person who makes it, and he will not, therefore, be permitted
to renounce his choice and take an alternative which was first
open to him. (Reyes v. Martinez, 55 Phil. 492)

Art. 1202

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(3) Reason for Communicating the Choice to Creditor

In the case of Ong Guan Can and Bank of the Phil. Islands
v. Century Insurance Co., 46 Phil. 592, the Supreme Court stated
that the debtor must notify the creditor “in order to give the
creditor opportunity to express his consent or to impugn the
election made the debtor." This is an error because if this were
so, the debtor is really being deprived of his right, under the
law, to make his own choice. The real purpose of the notice is to
inform the creditor that the obligation is now a simple one, no
longer alternative, and if already due, for the creditor to receive
the object being delivered, if tender of the same has been made.

COMMENT:
When Debtor Loses the Right of Choice
Example:

.

•

X is obliged to give Y either object A or object B or object
C. If objects A and B are lost by a fortuitous event before choice
can be made, X can deliver only object C, because the obligation
has become a simple one. If later, object C is also destroyed by
a fortuitous event, the obligation is extinguished, and X would
not be liable in any way.
San Jose v. Javier
L-6802, 1954

(4) Requisites for the Making of the Choice
(a)

made properly so that the creditor or his agent will actually
know;

(b)

made with full knowledge that a selection is indeed being
made. (Thus, ERROR in appreciating the meaning of
alternative obligations will give rise to vitiated consent,
and the choice can later on be annulled.);

(c)

made voluntarily and freely (without FORCE,
INTIMIDATION, COERCION, or UNDUE INFLUENCE);

(d)

made in due time, that is, before or upon maturity
(otherwise, the creditor can sue him in court with an
alternative relief as “give this or that, depending upon your
choice");

(e)

made to all the proper persons (Hence, if there be joint
creditors, all of them must be notified.);

(f)

made without conditions unless agreed to by the creditor
(otherwise, it can be said that no real choice is being made);

(g)

may be waived, expressly or impliedly (since all rights in
general may be waived).

Art. 1202. The debtor shall lose the right of choice when
among the prestations whereby he is alternatively bound,
only one is practicable.

Art. 1203

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHU JPPINES

A seller had an alternative: either to sell his house together
with his right of option, to buy the land on which it had been
constructed, or to return the advance payment given by the
buyer. If he loses the right to the option, he loses his right to
choose the sale of the house.
Art. 1203. If through the creditor’s acts the debtor cannot
make a choice according to the terms of the obligation, the
latter may rescind the contract with damages.

COMMENT:
Rule When Debtor Cannot Choose Because of Creditor’s
Acts
Example:

For P200.000, D promised to teach C mathematics for the
year 2005 or to buy for him a state-of-the-art computer notebook.
If in 2005, C goes to Germany, D obviously cannot teach him,
and since D is deprived of the right to choose because of Cs own
act (of leaving), D may either:
buy the state-of-the-art computer notebook.
(b) or rescind the contract with the right to recover whatever
damages he has suffered.
[NOTE: Please observe that the contract is not
automatically rescinded; the law says that the debtor “may

rescind,” implying that he may allow it to remain in
force
insofar as the possible choice or choices are involved.]

(c)

Art. 1204. The creditor shall have a right to indemnity
for damages when, through the fault of the debtor, all
the
things which are alternatively the object of the obligation
have been lost, or the compliance of the obligation has become
impossible.

The indemnity shall be fixed taking as a basis the value of
the last thing which disappeared, or that of the service
which
last become impossible.
Damages other than the value of the last thing or service
may also be awarded.

COMMENT:
(1) Alternative Rights of Creditor When Loss or
Impossibility
Occurs Before Debtor’s Choice
This Article applies when:
(a)

the right to choose belonged to the debtor;

(b)

and the loss or impossibility happened before selection was
made.

(2) Example

(a)

(b)

D is obliged to give C, at Us option, either object No. 1,
object No. 2 or object No. 3. If all objects were lost through
Z/s fault, the value of the last thing lost with damages must
be given to C. This is because if objects Nos. 1, 2, and 3
disappeared in that order, upon the loss of objects 1 and 2,
the obligations were converted into a simple one, namely
to give object No. 3. Thus, it is object No. 3’s value which
should be taken as a basis.

In the above example, if objects Nos. 1 and 2 were destroyed
by a fortuitous event, and later object No. 3 is destroyed
by Us fault, would D be liable?

*

Art 1205

If instead, objects Nos. 1 and 2 were destroyed by Us own
fault, and later object No. 3 is lost by a fortuitous event,
should D be held liable?

ANS.: It is believed that D should not be held liable.
D had all the right in the world to destroy objects Nos. 1
and 2, since he was free not to select them. In destroying
Nos. 1 and 2 he really made his choice and the obligation
to give has become a simple one to give No. 3. Loss of
the object of a simple obligation by fortuitous event should
as a rule extinguish any liability. (To avoid unfairness,
however, it would seem that immediately after the loss of
object No. 1 and object No. 2, the debtor must inform the
creditor of this fact.)

—

Art. 1205. When the choice has been expressly given to
the creditor, the obligation shall cease to be alternative from
the day when the selection has been communicated to the
debtor.
Until then the responsibility of the debtor shall be
governed by the following rules:
( 1 ) If one of the things is lost through a fortuitous event,
he shall perform the obligation by delivering that which the
creditor should choose from among the remainder, or that
which remains if only one subsists;
(2) If the loss of one of the things occurs through the
fault of the debtor, the creditor may claim any of those
subsisting, or the price of that which, through the fault of the
former has disappeared, with a right to damages;

(3) If all the things are lost through the fault of the
debtor, the choice by the creditor shall fall upon the price of
any one of them, also with indemnity for damages.

The same rules shall be applied to obligations to do or
not to do in case one, some or all of the prestations should
become impossible.

ANS.: Yes, because loss of objects Nos. 1 and 2
converted the obligation into a simple one, and D is liable
for object No. 3.

COMMENT:
(1) Rules When Choice Has Been Given to Creditor
(a) The Article gives the rules. For the choice to be given the
creditor, the right must expressly be given to him. It cannot
just be implied. Of course, the communication of choice by
him may be express or implied, such as when suit is made
for one of the objects.
(b) As in the case of the debtor, it should be understood that
the creditor loses the right to choose if only one of the
prestations is practicable. Thus, in a 1951 case, where
the creditor was entitled to demand, at maturity, either
English currency or the Philippine peso, he could only get
the Philippine peso (Japanese notes) because at time of
maturity (Feb. 17, 1943) only said currency was available,
all others having been outlawed. The debtor’s obligation
had ceased to be alternative and had become a simple one.
(Legarda, et al. v. Mialhe, GR 3435, April 28, 1951)
(c) Article 1205 does not apply when the contract does not
state to whom the right to choose is given, for in such case
it is the debtor who can choose.

(2) Example

D is obliged to give C either object No. 1 or object No. 2 or
object No. 3 at Cs option. Before C communicated his choice to
D, object No. 1 had been destroyed through Cs fault and object
No. 2 had been destroyed by a fortuitous event. What are Cs
rights, if any?

ANS.: C can demand:
(a) either object No. 3 (which is still there);
(b)

or the price of object No. 1 (with damages, in either case,
because C has been deprived of the right to select).
But C cannot ask for the value of object No. 2 since
this was lost fortuitously.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1206

debtor does not know what to deliver. Upon the other hand, if
the debtor wants to relieve himself, he may petition the court
to compel creditor to accept, in the alternative, at the creditor’s
option, with resultant damages if any.

Art. 1206. When only one prestation has been agreed
upon, but the obligor may render another in substitution, the
obligation is called facultative.

The loss or deterioration of the thing intended as a
substitute, through the negligence of the obligor, does not
render him liable. But once the substitution has been made,
the obligor is liable for the loss of the substitute on account
of his delay, negligence or fraud.

COMMENT:
(1) ‘Facultative Obligation’ Defined

It is one where only one prestation has been agreed upon
but the obligor may render another in substitution.
Example: D promised to give C his diamond-studded
ring but it was stipulated that D could give his BMW car as a

substitute.
(2) Distinctions Between the Alternative and the Facultative

Obligations
First, by example:

(a)

1)

2)

—

ALTERNATIVE D will give object No. 1 or object
No. 2. If object No. 1 is lost by a fortuitous event, D
will still have to give object No. 2.
FACULTATIVE D will give object No. 1 but if D
wants, he may give object No. 2. If object No. 1 is lost
by a fortuitous event, the obligation is extinguished
(because the principal object has been lost), and D
does not have to give object No. 2.

contrary to public morals or public policy, the mere absence of

(3) Query

The law says that “the loss or deterioration of the thing
intended as a substitute, through the negligence of the obligor,
does not render him liable.” (This is because the debtor can
always select the principal, and not necessarily the substitute.
And it is understood that the sentence above applies before choice
has been made.) Suppose instead of loss through “negligence,”
loss of the substitute was done deliberately should the debtor
be now held liable?

If the principal obligation
is void, and there is no
necessity of giving the

of the principal carries

Section 4

JOINT AND SOLIDARY OBLIGATION
I

•

Art. 1207. The concurrence of two or more creditors or
of two or more debtors in one and the same obligation does
not imply that each one of the former has a right to demand,
or that each one of the latter is bound to render, entire
compliance with the prestation. There is a solidary liability
only when the obligation expressly so states, or when the law
or the nature of the obligation requires solidarity.

COMMENT:
(1) Joint Distinguished from Solidary Obligations

In a joint obligation “each obligor answers only for a part
of the whole liability and to each obligee belongs only a part
of the correlative rights.” Whereas, in “a solidary or joint and
several obligation, the relationship between the active and the
passive subjects is so close that each of the former or of the latter
may demand the fulfillment of or must comply with the whole

For Joint Obligations:
(a) A and B are joint debtors of C to the amount of Pl,000,000.
C can demand only P500.000 from A, and only P500.000
from B.
Cb) A and B are joint debtors of C, D, E, and F, who are joint
creditors to the amount of Pl,000,000. C may demand only
P125.000 from A, and P125.000 from B. D, E, and F, have
the same rights as C.
For Solidary Obligations:
(a) A and B are solidary debtors of C to the amount of
Pl,000,000. C can demand the whole Pl,000,000 from A.
A in turn, after paying C, can ask reimbursement from B
to the amount of P500.000.
(b) A and B are solidary debtors of C, D, E, F, solidary creditors,
to the amount of Pl,000,000. Any creditor, like C, can
demand from any debtor, like A, the whole Pl,000,000. In

(5) Query

May the obligation be joint on the side of the creditors and
solidary on the side of the debtors or vice-versa?

ANS.: Yes. “In such cases, the rules applicable to each
subject of the obligation should be applied, the character of the
creditors or the debtors determining their respective rights and
liabilities.” (8 Manresa, pp. 201-202)
Examples:
(a)

A and B are joint debtors of C, D, E, and F, solidary creditors
to the amount of Pl,000,000. How much can C collect from
A?

ANS.: C is a solidary creditor, so presumably he can
collect the whole debt. But since A is only a joint debtor, C
is entitled to collect only P500.000 from A.

Art. 1207

A and B are solidary debtors of C, D, E,and F, joint creditors
to the amount of Pl,000,000. How much can C recover from
A?
ANS.: Since C is only a joint creditor, he can only

recover his share which is P250.000 from A, a solidary
debtor.

when there is a stipulation in the contract that the
obligation is solidary;
when the nature of the obligation requires liability to be
solidary;
when the law declares the obligation to be solidary.

[NOTE: Had C been solidary creditor, he could have
recovered Pl,000,000 from A; had A been a joint debtor,
and C, also a joint creditor, C could have recovered only
P125.000 from A.]

ISSUE: In the absence of any fact or law which would make
the defendants solidarity liable, are they jointly or solidarity
responsible?
HELD: The presumption is that they are only jointly liable.
Hence, Nigorra should pay only half of the debt.

Pimentel v. Gutierrez
14 Phil. 49
FACTS: Three persons signed a contract. No words were
used to make each liable for the whole amount.
HELD: Each one is liable only for his proportion or aliquot
share of the obligation. “If three persons sign a contract under
the provisions of the Civil Code, and no words are used to
make each liable for the full amount, each is only liable for the
proportionate amount of the contract. From a reading of the
contract in question, it will be seen that it is una obligation
mancomunaday no solidaria and that the three debtors are not
liable separately for the payment of the whole amount. They are
each liable for an aliquot part of the original obligation.”

FACTS: In an election contest, the protestee and the

and expenses of the intervenor is a joint and NOT a joint and

they are bound ‘jointly’ and not ‘solidarity.’” (Uk Pa Leung u.

Parot v. Gemora
7 Phil. 94
FACTS: Two people borrowed money and signed a
promissory note promising to pay “juntos o separadamente.’ Are
they jointly or solidarity liable?

HELD: They are solidarity liable. “We are of the opinion,
and so hold that the phrase 'juntos o separadamente’ used in
this promissory note, is an express statement, making each of
the persons who signed it individually liable for the payment of
the full amount of the obligation contained therein. The phrase
‘juntos o separadamente’ used in a contract creates the same
obligation as the phrase ‘mancomun o insolidum.’ The words
‘separadamente’ and ‘insolidum used in a contract in connection
with the nature of the liabilities of the parties are sufficient to
create an individual liability.”
Calo, Jr. v. Cabanos
L-19704, Oct. 19, 1966

If a father is a debtor and he dies, his heirs, up to the value
of the inheritance, are liable. Thus, before the heirs share in
the inheritance, the debt must first be paid. Thus also, it is not
accurate to say that the heirs are solidarity liable for the debt
of their father.

L-12634-12720, May 29, 1959

22 Phil. 42

FACTS: A and B were both responsible in causing an injury
to C through their (A’s and B's) negligence. C brought an action
against both. A maintains that his liability is only joint, not
solidary.

ISSUE: Are joint tortfeasors (those liable for a tort) jointly
or solidarily liable?

HELD: They are solidarily liable. “If several persons
jointly commit a tort, the plaintiff or the person injured has
his election to sue all or some of the parties jointly, or one of
them separately because the tort is in its nature a separate act
of each individual. (1 Chidey, Common Law Pleadings 86) It is
not necessary that the cooperation should be a direct, corporeal
act. It may be stated as a general rule that joint tortfeasors are
all the persons who command, instigate, promote, encourage,
advise, countenance, cooperate, aid or abet the commission of
a tort or who approve of it after it is done. They are each liable
as principals, to the same extent, and in the same manner as
if they had performed the wrongful act themselves.” (Cooley on
Torts, 133; Moir v. Hopkins, 16 III. 313)

Abella v. Co Bun Kim, et al.
100 Phil. 1019

ISSUE: What is the liability of a debtor and the receiver
of his property (as assignee in insolvency) joint or solidary?
HELD: The rules concerning joint and solidary obligations
(obligaciones mancomunadas y obligaciones solidarias) require
a plurality of subjects (creditors, debtors, or both), and have no
application when there is only one creditor and one debtor, even
if payment is to be made by several individuals, representing one
and the same interest or debtor. Thus, the liability of a debtor
and the receiver of his property in a litigation cannot be said to
be joint or solidary because the receiver does not represent an
interest completely distinct and separate from the owner of the
property, but is merely the custodian of the property, and an
extension of the personality of the latter.

FACTS: A, registered operator (in the Public Service Com.)
of a common carrier, sold the vehicle to B without prior approval
of the Commission. B then operated the vehicle. An accident
took place one day, injuring a passenger ofB.
ISSUE: Are A and B jointly or solidarily liable?

HELD: Only A, the registered owner is liable, but he can
recover indemnity from B. Since only one is liable, the distinction
between joint and solidary liability does not exist. A is liable as
a result of the culpa contractual (not culpa aquiliana) because
the vehicle was still registered under his name. This is true
even if the property had already been sold to another at the time
the accident took place. If the rule were otherwise, a registered
owner can easily evade responsibility by collusion with others
who may possess no property to answer for the damages. (See
Erezo v. Jepte, GR L-9605, Sept. 30, 1957)
NOTE: In Caners, et al. v. Arias, et al., (Court of Appeals)
GR L-24881-R, March 4, 1961, it was held that if the vehicle
which figured in an accident was operated under the so-called
“kabit system," the award of exemplary damages, among others,
payable jointly and severally by the operator and the grantee of
the certificate of public convenience is justified. This pernicious
system is not only a violation of law but a fraud upon the
travelling public, which has a right to expect that the holder of
the certificate be the one to actually operate his transportation
line, hire the drivers, and other employees and exercise the
necessary supervision over them.

Jereos v. Court of Appeals
L-48747, Sept. 30, 1982

In a civil action due to a quasi-delict (culpa aquiliana), the
registered owner, the actual owner, and the driver of the jeep
involved are solidarily liable. (See Erezo v. Jepte, 102 Phil. 103;

Fe Perez v. Josefina Gutierrez, et al.
L-30115, Sept. 28, 1973

FACTS: Gutierrez, holder of a certificate of public
convenience and authorized to operate an auto-caZesa in the
province of Davao, sold the vehicle to Alajar. The sale, at the
time of the accident, had not been approved by the Public
Service Commission, and was therefore not registered with
such Commission. Later, through the reckless imprudence of its
driver, Cordero, the vehicle met an accident resulting in injuries
to Perez, one of its passengers.
ISSUE: Who should be held liable to Perez?
HELD: The registered owner, Gutierrez, should be the one
directly Hable to Perez ( See Erezo u. Jepte) despite the transfer of
the vehicle to another. In dealing with vehicles registered under
the Public Service Law, the pubhc has right to presume that
the registered owner is the actual owner thereof, for it would
be difficult for the public to enforce the action for damages for
injuries caused to them by vehicles being negligently operated,
if the public should be required to prove who the actual owner
is. The transferee, however, should in turn be responsible to the
registered owner for in operating the vehicle without its transfer
having been approved by the Public Service Commission, the
transferee acted merely as an agent of the registered owner and
should be responsible to him. The driver should also be held
liable soUdarily with Gutierrez to Fe Perez in accordance with
the provisions of Art. 2184 in relation to Art. 2180 of the Civil
Code.
[NOTE: The driver was also held liable on the basis of a
quasi-delict, there being no contractual relation between him
and the passenger.]

Gonzales v. Halili, et al.
L-11521, Oct. 31, 1958

The liability of two motor vehicle drivers convicted for
injuries through reckless imprudence is solidary. Consequently,
the employer of each of them is also soUdarily liable with respect
to his subsidiary liability, as said Uability must necessarily be
co-extensive with the judgment against his employee.

Art. 1207

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Republic Planters Bank v. Court of Appeals
GR L-93073, Dec. 21, 1992

In the case at bar, the solidary liability of private
respondent Fermin Canlas is made clearer and certain, without
reason for ambiguity, by the presence of the phrase “joint and
several” as describing the unconditional promise to pay to the
order of RepubUc Planters Bank.
A joint and several note is one in which the makers bind
themselves both jointly and individually to the payee so that all
may be sued together for its enforcement, or the creditor may
select one or more as the object of the suit. A joint and several
obligation in common law corresponds to a civil law soUdary
obligation, i.e., one of several debtors bound in such wise that
each is Hable for the entire amount, and not merely for his
proportionate share. By making a joint and several promise to
pay to the order of RepubHc Planters Bank, private respondent
Canlas assumed the soUdary HabiUty of a debtor and the payee
may choose to enforce the notes against him alone or jointly with
defendant Shozo Yamaguchi and Pinch Manufacturing Corp, as
soUdary debtors.
As to whether the interpolation of the phrase “and (in) his
personal capacity” below the signatures of the makers in the
notes will affect the Uability of the makers, the Court does not
find it necessary to resolve and decide, because it is immaterial
and will not affect the liabihty of private respondent Canlas
as a joint and several debtor of the notes. With or without the
presence of said phrase, private respondent Canlas is primarily
Hable as a co-maker of each of the notes and his liabihty is that
of a solidary debtor.
(7) ‘Joint Tort-Feasors*

Under the Civil Code, joint tort-feasors are soUdary Uable
for the resulting damage. (Art. 2194, Civil Code)
Being each liable as principals, to the same extent and
in the same manner as if they had performed the wrongful act
themselves, joint tort-feasors are jointly and severally liable for
the whole amount?

(8) Surety’s Liability

FGU Insurance Corp. v. Roxas
836 SCRA 16
(2017)

A surety’s liability is joint and several with the principal.
Liability under a surety bond is “limited to the amount
of the bond” and is determined strictly in accordance with the
particular terms and conditions set out in the bond.
(9) Solidary Obligation in Labor-Only Contracting

Valencia v. Classique Vinyl Products Corp.
816 SCRA 144
(2017)

In labor-only contracting, the statute creates an employer¬
employee relationship for a comprehensive purpose, i.e., to
prevent a circumvention of labor laws.
The contractor is considered merely an agent of the prin¬
cipal employer and the latter is responsible to the employees of
the labor-only contractor as if such employees had been directly
hired by the principal employer.

The principal employer, therefore, becomes solidarity liable
with the labor-only contractors for all the rightful claims of the
employees.

and Manila Water jointly and solidarily liable for their failure to
put up sewage lines and sewage treatment facilities in violation
of Sec. 8 of RA 9275 which mandates the connection of existing
sewage lines in all subdivisions, condominiums, commercial
centers, and other establishments, including households, to an

available sewerage system.

Art. 1208

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1208. If from the law, or the nature or the wording
of the obligations to which the preceding article refers the
contrary does not appear, the credit or debt shall be presumed
to be divided into as many equal shares as there are creditors
or debtors, the credits or debts being considered distinct
from one another, subject to the Rules of Court governing the
multiplicity of suits.

COMMENT:
(1) Presumption That Obligation Is Joint
This Article gives us the presumption that when there are
two or more debtors, or two or more creditors, the obligation is
joint and as a consequence:
(a) The debt shall be divided into as many shares as there are
creditors or debtors.
(b) The credits or the debts will be distinct from one another,
BUT regarding the bringing of the action in court, the
Rules of Court governing the multiplicity of suits will be
followed.
(2) Distinct Shares

In joint obligations, the different shares of the debt or the
credit are considered distinct from one another. But they are
subject to the Rules of Court governing the multiplicity of suits.
This means that ordinarily one creditor may sue one of the
debtors for the latter’s share of the obligation. But, in view of the
fact that the aim of the Rules of Court is to obtain a just, speedy,
and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding,
it would be much better to sue all the necessary parties at the
same time.
(3) Some Decided Cases

Compania General de Tabacos v. Obed
13 Phil. 391

FACTS: A mother and her son borrowed money. Nothing
was said in the contract regarding solidary liability. But in the
brief presented by the lawyer for mother and son, the two debtors
unwittingly said they were solidarily liable.
299

298

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1208

ISSUE: Doea the statement in the brief of the lawyer
convert the joint obligation into a solidary one?
HELD: No. The statement in the brief is immaterial. What
must prevail is the contract in question, and since nothing is
mentioned therein relating to solidarity, the obligation is only
joint.

Oriental Commercial Co. v. Abeto
60 Phil. 723
FACTS: A borrowed money from B on the strength of two
sureties, C and D, who assumed joint and several liability with
A. The trial judge, upon non-payment of the debt, rendered
a judgment against all the defendants (A, C, D) for the total
amount sought by B. But the judgment did not state whether
the liability of the defendants was joint or solidary. B then asked
for execution on the properties of C, one of the sureties for the
whole obligation.

ISSUE: In the contract, liability was solidary but in the
judgment, nothing was said about the nature of the obligation,
hence it is now merely joint and not solidary. How will the
obligation now be considered: joint as in the judgment, or
solidary as in the contract?
HELD: The obligation should now be considered as merely
a joint one; hence, B can get from the properties of C only the
proportional share of C. The judgment did not state that the
obligation was joint and several, so none of the defendants may
be required to pay for the whole obligation. It does not matter
that under the provisions of the written contract entered into
by the parties the obligation contracted by the sureties was
solidary. It must be remembered that there was no appeal from
said judgment, and hence the judgment was final. Since the final
judgment superseded the action brought for the enforcement
of said contract and since it implicitly declared the obligation
to be joint and not solidary, it follows that said final judgment
cannot be executed otherwise. Hence, it should be executed as
imposing merely joint liabilities.

the amount is to be paid by them jointly or solidarity.
HELD: If from the law or the nature or the wording of

distinct from one another. (See Art. 128)

(6) Some Consequences of Joint Liability

Vitiated consent on the part of one debtor does not affect
the others.
Example: A and B are joint debtors of C for Pl ,000,000.
A’s consent was obtained by C through fraud. B would still
be liable for P500,000, while A will not be liable, since the
two debts are considered distinct from each other.
(b) Insolvency of one debtor does not make others responsible
for his share.
Example: A, B, and C are joint debtors of D for
P3,000,000. If A is insolvent, how much should B pay D?
ANS.: Only Pl,000,000, his own proportionate share.
(c) Demand by the creditor on one joint debtor puts him in
default, but not the others since the debts are distinct.
(d) When the creditor interrupts the running of the prescriptive
period by demanding judicially from one, the others are not
affected. (Therefore, it is possible that the share of one joint
debtor has not prescribed, while those of the others have
already prescribed.) (Agoncillo and Marino v. Javier, 38
Phil. 424 and 1 Geogi 83; 33 Dallos 297)
(e) Defenses of one debtor are not necessarily available to the
(a)

others. (See 8 Manresa 200-201)

If it arises out of a crime or a quasi delict, the liability is
solidary (together with the partnership). (Arts. 1822, 1823,
and 1824, Civil Code)

Liwanag, et al. v. Workmen’s Compensation
Commission
L-12164, May 22, 1959
FACTS: Roque Balderama, a security guard of a
partnership, the Liwanag Auto Supply, was killed in line of
duty. His heirs claim compensation under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act.
ISSUE: The Act being silent on the point, what is the
liability of the partners joint or solidary?
HELD: Solidary. It is true that ordinarily, the liability
of partners is only joint, but this should not apply to a case of
compensation for death in line of duty. Articles 1711 and 1712
of the Civil Code, taken together with Sec. 2 of the Workmen’s
Compensation Law, reasonably indicate that in compensation
cases, the liability of business partners should be solidary,
otherwise the right of the employee may be defeated, or at least
crippled. If the responsibility of the partners were to be merely
joint and not solidary, and one of them happens to be insolvent,
the amount awarded would only be partially satisfied. This is
evidently contrary to the intent and purposes of the Act, which
is to give full protection to the employees.

Relations) of the Civil Code

Although the law does not expressly say so, it is believed
that infractors thereof should be held liable in solidum
considering the fact that said violations are either penal in
nature or contrary to morals. These are perhaps cases where
there is solidarity because of the nature of the obligation. (See

Art. 1207, Civil Code)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
(1) Indivisible Joint Obligation

This Article speaks of an indivisible joint obligation
referring to the OBJECT; joint referring to the
TIE between the parties, who are merely proportionately liable,
unless solidarity has been stipulated by the parties or the law,
in which case, it is called a solidary indivisible obligation).

(indivisible

—

—

(2) Example of a Joint Indivisible Obligation

Tortious Act

A and B are jointly liable to give C this particular car.

Here, the liability of an employer is primary (not
subsidiary), and solidary with that of the employees. (Arts.
2180 and 2194, Civil Code) However, if the injured party does
not appeal from an erroneous judgment holding the liability to
be merely subsidiary, instead of solidary, the same becomes res
judicata, and the obligation ceases to be solidary. (Bachrach
Motor Co. v. Gamboa, L-10296, May 21, 1957)
(12) Query

If a contract states “Jose or Maria will pay you Pl,000,000”
(disjunctive obligations), should this be considered alternative,
joint, or solidary?

ANS.: It really depends upon the intention of the parties.
Hence, if what is intended is to have the obligation satisfied in
full, the payer being immaterial, the courts may be inclined to
consider the same as solidary, with the creditor being given the
right to select who would pay, and in case of partial performance
merely, he can still ask the other for the balance.

(3) Manresa’s Comment

“The obligation is in a sense midway between the joint and
the solidary, although it preserves the two characteristics of the
joint obligation in that: (a) no creditor can do an act prejudicial
to the others, and (b) no debtor can be made to answer for the
others. The peculiarity of this obligation, however, is that its
fulfillment requires the consent of all the debtors, although each
for his part. On the side of the creditors, collective action is also
required for acts which may be prejudicial.” (8 Manresa 197)
(4) Characteristics
(a)

The obligation is joint but since the object is indivisible,
the creditor must proceed against ALL the joint debtors
(Art. 1209), for compliance is possible only if all the joint
debtors would act TOGETHER.

(b)

Demand must, therefore, be made on ALL the joint debtors.
If any one of the debtors does not comply with his monetary
obligation for damages. (Art. 1224, Civil Code; 8 Manresa

(c)

237-238)

Art 1209. If the division is impossible, the right of the
creditors may be prejudiced only by their collective acts, and
the debt can be enforced only by proceeding against all the
debtors. If one of the latter should be insolvent, the others
shall not be liable for his share.

(d)

If any of the joint debtors be insolvent, the others shall not
be liable for his share. (Art. 1209, Civil Code)
[NOTE: The obligation to pay monetary damages is
of course no longer indivisible, and therefore, the creditor
may go against each debtor individually, subject to the
provisions of the Rules of Court.]

(e)

not merely to one, unless that one be specifically authorized
by the others.

(f)

Each joint creditor is allowed to renounce his proportionate
credit.

(5) Example

A, B, and C are jointly liable to give a particular car
worth Pl.2 million in favor of D, E, F, and G. A is insolvent and
the debtors, therefore, cannot purchase the car to give to the
creditors. D and E have renounced their rights. The debtors are
not in default. How much can each of the creditors get from each
of the debtors?

ANS.: Since this is a joint and indivisible obligation and
since the car cannot be given, it is converted into an obligation
to give indemnity for damages. Since this is a joint obligation,
each debtor is proportionately liable and each creditor is only
entitled to his proportional credit.

that the debtor is in default with reference to the demanding
creditor’s share. Is she also in default with reference to the
others?
ANS.: Although it would seem that the answer is YES,
because this act benefits, and does not prejudice the others, and
is therefore implicitly what the law provides (See 8 Manresa
197), still it should be borne in mind that the credits are still
independent of one another (See by analogy from the decision
of the Supreme Court of Lousiana, Buard v. Lemes Syndic., 12
Robinson’s Reports, p. 243), and, therefore, the answer should
be NO.

and terms: Cs share will be due at the end of the year; D
will get his share only if he passes the bar; and E will get
his share only after he (E) has painted the house ofX. Here,
the obligation is still solidary.
(c)

Supposing the obligation is to be subject to different
terms and conditions, the following is the solution:
the creditor may recover that part which is pure and
unconditional, and should leave in suspense or pending,
the right to demand the payment of the remainder
until the expiration of the term or the fulfillment of the
condition. Solidarity is still preserved by recognizing in the
creditor the power, upon the fulfillment of the condition
or the expiration of the term, of claiming from any or
all of the debtors, that part of the obligation effected by
these conditions.” (Scaevola, Codigo Civil Comentado y

only be due and demandable at the end of the year, and E
and Cfs shares will be due and demandable only upon the
fulfillment of the condition.

Inchausti & Co. v. Yulo
34 Phil. 978

FACTS: A, B, C, D, and E borrowed money from F. The
contract stipulated solidary one, and the debtors were bound
under different terms and conditions. F brought an action to

recover from A, whose obligation was already due. A claims that
he cannot be made to pay because the obligations incurred by
his solidary co-debtors were not yet due.
ISSUE: When the debtors of a solidary obligation are bound
by different terms and conditions, may the creditor sue one of
them?
HELD: Yes, the creditor may sue the one whose share has
already become due and demandable but the creditor cannot
recover yet from the debtor sued, the shares of the other debtors,
until the conditions or terms of the others have already been
fulfilled. In other words, F may recover now from A only A’s
share; and when the conditions and terms have been fulfilled
for the shares of B, C, D, and E, the creditor F can recover their
shares from A. This, after all, is still a solidary obligation.

and Cs share of P100.000, or a total of only P100.000. In

(1) General Rule about Non-assignment of Rights by Solidary

Suppose X instead made a demand on C in 2021, how much
can he collect from C?

ANS.: Only P100.000, the share corresponding to A,
because Cs own share has not yet matured and B has not
yet passed the bar.
[NOTE: In both problems, the rule is that the whole
solidary obligation can be recovered from ANY of the
solidary debtors MINUS the share of those with unmatured
conditions or terms. (See 8 Manresa 203)]

Art. 1212. Each one of the solidary creditors may do
whatever may be useful to the others, but not anything which
may be prejudicial to the latter.

COMMENT:
Solidary Creditors May Do Useful, Not Prejudicial Acts

—

Example of Beneficial Act To interrupt the running of
prescription, the act of one solidary creditor in making
a judicial demand upon any of the solidary debtors is
sufficient. The law provides that: “The prescription of
actions is interrupted when they are filed before the
Courts.” (Art. 1155, 1st clause, Civil Code)
(b) Prejudicial Acts
should not be performed, otherwise,
there will be liability for damages. However, in the case of
remission or condonation (which is really prejudicial), the
solidaiy creditor is allowed to so remit, and the obligation
is extinguished, without prejudice to his liability to the
other creditors. (See Art. 1215, Civil Code)
(a)

—

Art. 1213. A solidary creditor cannot assign his rights

Creditor
The solidary creditor cannot assign his rights.

Exception:

He is allowed if all the others consent.
Reason for the Law:
Essentially, a solidary obligation implies mutual agency
and mutual confidence. Should the assignee or substitute do acts
which would prejudice the others (as when he absconds after
receiving payment), there is no doubt that the other creditor’s
right are endangered, hence, the necessity of their consent.
(2) Criticism by Justice J.B.L. Reyes

“The rule (of non-assignment without the other’s consent)
is JUSTIFIABLE and places an unnecessary restriction on the
rights of the solidary co-creditors upon his share. The reason
behind it seems to be that each creditor represents the others
and, therefore, must have the confidence of the latter. But in
the first place, confidence between co-creditors cannot properly
be said to exist except in the case of a solidary credit by contract
(note that the law is the one that imposes solidarity in some
obligations, not the mutual agreement of the parties). In the
second place, representation (by each creditor) of the solidary
creditors is created by law and not by consent or agreement of
the parties. If danger is seen in the possible misfeasance of the
assignee, the remedy is not the paralyzation of the proprietary
rights to the solidary creditor, but to impose upon him a
subsidiary responsibility for the acts of the assignee, similar
to that of the agent for the acts of sub-agent under Art. 1892.”
This is Manresa’s view in his comment to Art. 1141 of the Code
of 1889. So that Art. 1213 should have been made to read: “A
solidary creditor who assigns his rights without the consent
of his co-creditors shall answer subsidiarily for any prejudice
caused to the latter by the assignee in connection with the
credit.” (Lawyer's Journal, Observations on the new Civil Code,
Jan. 31, 1951, p. 48)

be made to C, who had made the extrajudicial demand,
still the law should not be construed to effect an absurdity
in that D and E would be compelled to just stand by idly,
since C does not institute any judicial action. Since Cs act
(or inaction) is prejudicial to D and E, the two (D and E)
should be allowed to make the judicial demand. (See Art.

(e) A and B, solidarity debtors, are indebted to C, D, and E,
solidary creditors. C extrajudicially demands from A,
but B (upon whom no demand has been made), pays the
whole debt to E. Is B allowed to do that, and is the solidary
obligation extinguished?
ANS.: Yes, for after all no demand had been made by
C upon B. It is only A that is bound, not B. (See 8 Manresa
210)

Art. 1215. Novation, compensation, confusion or remission
of the debt, made by any of the solidary creditors or with any of
the solidary debtors, shall extinguish the obligation, without
prejudice to the provision of Article 1219.
The creditor who may have executed any of these acts, as
well as he who collects the debt, shall be liable to the others
for the share in the obligation corresponding to them.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Novation

ANS.: In the meantime, no, because C is supposed to
be representing already D and E. If judgment is rendered
against A, and A does not have enough money, then D, E,
or C (individually or collectively) may still sue B for the
remainder. But it is essential that the first action be first
terminated.

Novation is the modification of an obligation by changing
its object or principal conditions, or by substituting the person
of the debtor, or by subrogating the person of the debtor, or by
subrogating a third person in the rights of creditor. (Art. 1291,

painting JTs house, has arisen. If B did not consent to the
novation, B will not be bound to X and Y in any way, and
moreover, will not be obliged to give A anything except
insofar as he (B) has been benefited. Upon the other hand
only X will be allowed to prejudice his co-creditor Y, so X
must reimburse Y for P400.000 (which is really Ys share
of the credit). (Art. 1215, 2nd par.)

it was A’s credit that was used to compensate. So B owes
A P200.000 (his share of the debt). Upon the other hand,
Y should not be prejudiced, so Y can recover P200,000 (hia
credit) from X. (Art. 1215, par. 2)
(b) Example of Partial Compensation in Connection with
Solidary Obligations:

A and B are solidary debtors of X. If A is granted an
extension of time within which to pay, is B released from
the obligation?

A and B are solidary debtors of C to the amount of
P2,000,000, but C is indebted to A for P500.000. This is a
case of partial compensation, and therefore the solidary
obligation amounting to Pl,500,000 still subsists.

ANS.: No. (See Phil. Guaranty v. Jose, O.G. Aug. 16,
1941, p. 1475) The only effect is this: if X sues B, B will pay
the whole debt minus the share of A. When the extended
period terminates, X can demand the remaining balance
(A’s share) from either A or B. And if B pays again, B will
now have the right to collect reimbursement from A, for
A’s share. (See Inchausti and Co. v. Yulo, 34 Phil. 978)
[NOTE: The rule is different in suretyship, where
although the surety is also, in a way, a solidary debtor,
an extension of time to the principal debtor without the
surety’s consent will release the surety from the contract.
(See Phil. Nat. Bank v. Veraguth, 50 Phil. 253)]
(2) Effect of Compensation

Compensation is that which takes place when two persons,
in their own right, are creditors and debtors of each other. (Art.
1278, Civil Code) (as when A owes B Pl,000,000 and B owes
A Pl,000,000). Compensation may be total or partial, depending
upon the amount involved. Total compensation of course
automatically extinguishes the obligation, whether known or
unknown to the parties. (See Art. 1290, Civil Code)

Art. 1216

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Example of Total Compensation in Connection with
Solidary Obligation:

A and B are solidary debtors of X and Y, solidary
creditors to the amount of P400,000. But X owes A P400.000
on account of a different obligation. Here we have a case of
automatic extinguishment of the obligation by virtue of total
compensation. But B should not benefit completely since

(3) Effect of Confusion (or Merger)

Confusion or merger is that which takes place when
the characters of creditor and debtor are merged in the same
person (Art. 1275, Civil Code), as when my check in the course
of negotiation, is eventually endorsed to me.

Example:

A and B made a negotiable promissory note in favor of C
and D, whereby A and B bound themselves solidarity to C and
D, solidary creditors. C and D endorsed the note in favor of E;
E in favor of F; F in favor of A. Notice that A, who is a debtor,
now becomes a creditor. There is merger or confusion of rights
here; the solidary obligation is extinguished; but B is indebted
to A for his (B’s) share of the debt.
(4) Effect of Remission (or Waiver)

Remission or waiver is that act of liberality whereby a
creditor condones the obligation of the debtor; that where the
creditor tells the debtor to “forget about the whole thing.” (See
Art. 1270, Civil Code) (Remission may be total or partial)
(a)

Example of Total Remission:
A and B are solidary debtors of X and Y, solidary
creditors to the amount of P4 million. X tells A that he was
waiving the whole obligation. Here, the total remission
completely extinguishes the whole obligation, without
prejudice to Y collecting from X his (Ys) share of the credit
of P2 million, otherwise Xs remission would prejudice Y.
315

314

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1216

Upon the other hand, B does not have to reimburse A for
anything, for after all the remission was a gratuitous act
and A did not have to give anything to the creditors. (See
8 Manresa, pp. 225-226)
(b)

Example of Partial Remission:
A, B, and C are solidary debtors of X in the amount
of P3 million. X then made a demand from A but collected
only P2 million because he (X) was remitting A’s share (of
Pl million). How much can A recover from B and C?
ANS.: Only Pl million from each because the solidary
debt of P3 million had been reduced by partial remission
to only P2 million.
[NOTE: It follows, in the example given, that A can
be reimbursed the whole P2 million (plus interest in the
proper case), and therefore it is as if A did not have to pay
from his own pocket. This is but just because after all, A’s
share had been remitted. This example is also a correct
illustration of the rule that a partial remission benefits
ALL in that the solidary debt is diminished, so that if A had
not been able to pay, or had the creditor chosen to collect
from either B or C, he can demand not P3 million but only
P2 million. (See Inchausti & Co. v. Yulo, 34 Phil. 978)]

[NOTE: Although from said viewpoint all had been
benefited, it should be noted that the individual shares of
B and C have NOT really been diminished.]
[NOTE: Under Art. 1219, if the share of a solidary
debtor is remitted by the creditor after another solidary
debtor had paid the whole obligation, the remission is
useless because there was really nothing more the creditor
could remit in view of the complete payment. In such a case,
the debtor whose share was remitted can still be made to
reimburse his share to the payor-debtor. Inferentially , had
remission preceded payment, the debtor whose share has
been remitted cannot be made to reimburse anything, for
after all, the payor-debtor will have paid only the balance
of the debt (after deducting the share of the debtors who
has received the benefit of the remission).]

Art. 1216

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1216. The creditor may proceed against any one of the
solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously. The
demand made against one of them shall not be an obstacle to
those which may subsequently be directed against the others,
so long as the debt has not been fully collected.

COMMENT:
(1) Against Whom Creditor May Proceed

Against any, some, or all of the solidary debtors
simultaneously.

Constante Amor de Castro v. Court of Appeals
GR 11838, July 18, 2002
When the law expressly provides for solidarity of the
obligation, as in the liability of co-principals in a contract
of agency, each obligor may be compelled to pay the entire
obligation. The agent may recover the whole compensation
from any one of the co-principals in a contract of agency, each
obligor may be compelled to pay the entire obligation. The agent
may recover the whole compensation from any one of the co¬
principals, as in this case.
Indeed Art. 1216 of the Civil Code provides that a creditor
may sue any of the solidary debtors. Solidarity does not make
a solidary obligor an indispensable party in a suit filed by
the creditor. Article 1216 says that the creditor may proceed
against anyone of the solidary debtors or some or all of them
simultaneously.
(2) Effect of Not Proceeding against All

If the creditor sues only one, or two, or several of the debtors
(but not all) there is no waiver against those not yet sued. They
may be proceeded against later. (See Art. 1216; see also Guerrero
v. Court of Appeals, L-22366, Oct. 30, 1969)
(3) Applicability of Art 1216

Note that Art. 1216 applies only to solidary obligations,
not to joint ones, for in the latter, failure to collect from one
joint debtor his share does not authorize the creditor to proceed

Differences

Phil. National Bank v. Concepcion Mining Co^ et al.
L-16968, July 31, 1962

1)

FACTS: In a solidary obligation evidenced by a promissory
note, the solidary debtors were the Concepcion Mining Co.,
Vicente L. Legarda, and Jose S. Sarte. Legarda was not sued,
however, because he had died before the suit began. The other
debtors then asked that the estate of Legarda be included as a

The solidary debtor is indebted for his own share
only; the surety is indebted only for the share of the
principal debtor.

2)

Hence, the solidary debtor can be reimbursed what
he has paid MINUS his own share; the surety can be
reimbursed for everything he paid.

3)

If a solidary debtor receives an extension of the
period for payment, the others are still liable for the
whole obligation now, minus the share of the debtor
who has received the extension (but same share can
be demandable also from them upon the arrival of
the extended term). If a principal debtor receives an
extension, without the surety’s consent, the surety
is released. (See Phil. Guaranty v. Jose, O.G., Aug.
16, 1941, p. 1475; and Stevenson v. Climaco, 36 O.G.

party-defendant.
HELD: The estate of Legarda does not have to be sued
since under Art. 1216, the creditor or payee of the promissory
note may sue ANY of the solidary debtors.

Phil. National Bank v. Nuevas
L-21255, Nov. 29, 1965
Article 1216 applies even if the suit is for the revival of
a judgment. Hence, if in the judgment, all the debtors were
declared “jointly and severally liable,” the entire judgment may
be enforced against ANY of them.

Operators Incorporated v. American Biscuit Co., Inc.
GR 34767, Oct 23, 1987

Even if the solidary nature of the debtor’s liability is selfevident, the creditor cannot disregard an arbitration clause
stipulated in the contracts. Solidarity does not make a solidary
obligor an indispensable party in a suit filed by the creditor.
(4) Passive Solidarity

Article 1216 applies to what is called passive solidarity
(solidarity among the debtors). It can also apply to mixed
solidarity.
(5) Passive Solidarity and Suretyship

(6) Examples
(a)

A and B are solidary debtors of C to the amount of
Pl,000,000. Either A or B may be made to pay the whole
Pl ,000,000 but the payer can collect half (P500.000) from
the other (since each is a principal debtor).

(b)

A borrowed from C Pl,000,000. B acted as surety (solidary
guarantor) for A. C can demand Pl,000,000 from either
A or B. But if B is made to pay, B can demand the whole
Pl,000,000 from A since B is not really a principal debtor.
[NOTE: A guarantor binds himself subsidiarily to
answer for the principal debtor, in case of insolvency;
hence, the creditor cannot immediately proceed against
the guarantor; a surety is a guarantor who binds himself
solidarity with the principal debtor, hence, creditor can
proceed against the surety immediately (that is, without
first exhausting the properties of the principal debtor). (See

(7) Problems
(a)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

A and B are solidary debtors of X and Y to the amount of
P4 million. X sued A but recovered only P3.5 million. May
Y still sue B for P500.000?
ANS.: Yes, because the debt has not yet been entirely

satisfied.
(b) A and B are solidary debtors of X and Y. X sues A but A
wins the case (for example, on the ground that the subject
matter is illegal). Can Y still sue B?
ANS.: No more because here the principle of res
judicata clearly applies. Since X was representing Y, there
would be identity of parties.
Art. 1217. Payment made by one of the solidary debtors
extinguishes the obligation. If two or more solidary debtors
offer to pay, the creditor may choose which offer to accept.
He who made the payment may claim from his co-debtors
only the share which corresponds to each, with the interests
for the payment already made. If the payment is made before
the debt is due, no interest for the intervening period may be

demanded.
When one of the solidary debtors cannot, because of
his insolvency, reimburse his share to the debtor paying the
obligation, such share shall be borne by all his co-debtors, in
proportion to the debt of each.

(a)

If a solidary debtor pays the creditor, what happens to the
obligation?

ANS.: The obligation is extinguished. “Payment made
by one of the solidary debtors extinguishes the obligation.”
(1st sentence, Art. 1217, Civil Code)
(b)

A, B, and C are the solidary debtors of D. A and B offer to
pay. Is the creditor allowed to choose which offer to accept?

ANS.: Yes. “If two or more solidary debtors offer to
pay, the creditor may choose which to accept.” (Art. 1217,
(c)

2nd sentence, Civil Code)
Suppose in problem (b), although A and B have offered to
pay, D nevertheless makes a demand upon C, is D allowed
to do so?

ANS.: Even if C has not offered to pay, it is believed
that D would be allowed to make a demand upon C. “The
creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary
debtors.” fist sentence, Art. 1216, Civil Code). But, of course,
it would be a foolish creditor who would refuse to accept
payment from one who offers it.
(d) A, B, C, and D are solidary debtors of E to the amount of
Pl.2 million. A pays E the whole Pl.2 million. Is A entitled
to reimbursement from B, C, and DI
ANS.: Yes, reimbursement plus interest from the date
of payment.
(4) Nature of Liability for Reimbursement

COMMENT:
(1) Effects of Payment

The Article gives the effects of payment.
(2) Tayment’ Defined

Payment is one of the ways by which an obligation is
extinguished and consists in the delivery of the thing or the
rendition of the service which is the object of the obligation.

A, B, C, and D are solidary debtors of E to the amount of
Pl.2 million. A paid E the whole amount of Pl.2 million. It is
clear that A is entitled to reimbursement for now A has become
the creditor for reimbursement. Are B, C, and D considered the
solidary debtors of A?
ANS.: No. With reference to the reimbursement B, C, and
D are not solidary debtors of A but merely joint debtors of A.
It is true that B, C, and D, together with A, used to be solidary
debtors of E, but A’s payment to E of the whole amount has
321

320

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1217

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

extinguished that solidary obligation, and what remains now
is merely the joint obligation of reimbursement. As a matter of
fact, the law provides that: “He who made the payment may
claim from his co-debtors only the share which corresponds to
each, with the interest for payment already made.” (1st sentence,
second par., Art. 1217, Civil Code) This clearly shows that the
solidary obligation which has been extinguished has now been
converted into a joint obligation for reimbursement; otherwise,
the law would not have provided that what the paying debtors
r»n recover is only the proportionate share, with interest.
Since originally there were four debtors, each has a
proportional share of P300,000 in the obligation. Hence, A can
recover P300,000 with interest from each of the other three.
It should be noted, however, that the liability is not the
ordinary joint one, for in the instant case, the insolvency of
one must in the meantime be shouldered by the rest. (Last par.,

Wilson v. Berkenkotter
92 Phil. 918
FACTS: In 1938, three persons A, B, and C signed as
solidary debtors a promissory note in favor of the Chartered
Bank of India in the amount of P90.000. In 1944, during the
Japanese occupation, B paid the whole amount in Japanese
notes. In 1950 (after liberation), A offered to pay B his (A’s) share
in the obligation. The issue is whether P30,000 or only P600
(the equivalent of P30,000 under the Ballantyne scale) must be
reimbursed, considering that payment by B to the bank was in
Japanese money.

"

HELD: It has been held in several cases that a debt
contracted during the Japanese occupation, and payable on
demand or during the occupation (but not after the war or at
a specified date thereafter as to indicate that the parties were
speculating on the ending or continuation of the war) would be
paid under the Ballantyne scale. In this case, therefore, we have
to find out when the obligation of A to B was created, whether it
was before the war or during the war. If during the war, then the
Ballantyne scale should be sufficient. And our decision is that
in this case, the obligation to reimburse was made only during
the war since before payment by B, A was not yet B’s debtor.
Hence, the correct sum is P600.

(6) Substitution of Parties

P225.000.
ISSUE: How much can A recover from the other solidary
debtors?

HELD: A can recover the proportional shares of the other,
not with respect to P253,445.42 but with respect to P225.000,
the amount as reduced. Since there are six solidary debtors, he
can recover 1/6 of P225,000 from each plus interest from the

time of payment.
(5) Basis of the Right to be Reimbursed

The fact of payment (and not the original contract) is the
basis of the right to be reimbursed, for not until then had he
the right to be reimbursed. Hence, the obligation of the others
to reimburse him arises only from the time payment is made.

he against A and Bl
323

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1218

ANS.: Yes, D can get the whole P300.000 from C, because
C bound himself in solidum. If C pays the whole amount, B and
A will each be liable to him for P100.000. (See Arts. 1216 and

undersigned, promise solidarily to pay C or his order, on or
before May 1, 2005, the sum of Pl,000,000, plus an interest of
6% (Sgd.) A and B." Should B turn out to be insolvent, may C
recover all his claim from A who is solvent? Why?
ANS.: Yes, because A had bound himself solidarily, without
prejudice, of course, to his recovering later on from B, the share
of B in the debt, plus interest from the date of payment. (Art.
1217, Civil Code)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Payment of Prescribed Debt

A and B are solidary debtors of C to the amount of
Pl,000,000.

The debt prescribed. But A voluntarily paid C, nevertheless,
because A felt morally obliged to so pay.
(a) May A recover from C what he has paid?
(b)

ANS.:
A cannot recover from C what he has paid because it
was voluntarily given after A knew of the prescription of
the debt. The law says, “when a right to sue upon a civil
obligation has lapsed by extinctive prescription, the obligor
cannot recover what he has delivered or the value of the
service he has rendered.” (Art. 1424, Civil Code) [NOTE:
If payment had been made by A to C, without A knowing
that the debt had prescribed, A can recover from C on the
basis of solutio indebiti.]

(b)

A cannot get any reimbursement from B because A paid the
debt after it had prescribed. The law says, “Payment by a
solidary debtor shall not entitle him to reimbursement from
his co-debtors if such payment is made after the obligation
has prescribed or become illegal.” (Art. 1218, Civil Code)

A, B, and C are joint and several debtors of D. D allows C

indebtedness. Upon being sued by D, may A and B interpose the
defense of the extension of the time granted to C? Should A and
B eventually pay the entire obligation, may they compel C to
reimburse them with his share without waiting for the two-year
extension granted to D? Reasons.
ANS.: Yes, A and B can set up the extension but only as
partial defense, limited to Cs share. Hence, they should now
pay ALL minus Cs share. (See Inchausti v. Yulo, 34 Phil. 978)
If they paid ALL (without deductions) they must wait for the
two-year period before they can compel reimbursement from C.
This is because A and B merely stepped into the shoes of the
creditor D, and therefore C can plead against them the defense
of extension of payment.

him to reimbursement from his co-debtors if such payment is

Pl,000,000. Later, the law prohibits the transaction of said
drugs, and declares the drugs to be outside the commerce of
man. Knowing this, A nevertheless delivers the drugs to C. May
A now get reimbursement from B?

ANS.: No, A cannot get any reimbursement from B because
A made the payment after the obligation had become illegal.

remission was effected.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Remission Made After Total Payment Had
Already Extinguished the Obligation
This Article is designed to prevent fraud and to give
justice to the paying debtor. (See 8 Manresa 226) Example: A
and B solidarily owe X Pl ,000,000. A paid X the whole amount.
Later, X remitted B's share. Can A still recover reimbursement
of P500.000 from Bl
ANS.: Yes.

Since payment extinguishes the obligation, there is nothing
more to remit. (See Comments under Art. 1215, Civil Code)
(3) Problems

A, B, and C solidarily owe X P3 million. X remitted Cs
share. A, therefore, paid later only P2 million. Can A
recover reimbursement?
ANS.: Yes, but only from B and not from C, whose
share had previously been remitted. Here, remission was
previous to the payment.
(b) In problem (a), how much can A recover from B and C?
ANS.: From B, Pl million with interest. From C,
nothing, because Cs share had been remitted.

In problem (b), suppose B is insolvent, can C be made liable
in the meantime for part of the insolvency? In other words,
can A get anything from C, whose share the creditor had

been remitted (and even if he therefore does not have to
reimburse for his own share) he will still have to bear part
of the burden of B’s insolvency, because the creditor’s act
of liberality towards him cannot excuse him from fulfilling
his legal duty under the provision hereinabove mentioned.
Thus, B’s share of Pl million will be borne in the meantime
by A and C, and C will have to give P500.000 to A. Later,
C can recover from B, should the latter’s finances improve.

by one of the solidary debtors, does not entitle him to

ANS.: Yes, because under Art. 1217, “when one of

reimburse his share to the debtor paying the obligation,
such share must be borne by all his co-debtors in proportion
to the debt of each.” In other words, even if Cs share has

(1) Remission of the Whole Obligation

This Article is a new provision of the Civil Code. Remission,
it must be borne in mind, is essentially gratuitous. Note that
this Article applies only when the whole obligation is remitted.
(2) Example

A and B are solidary debtors of C to the amount of
Pl ,000,000. C remitted the whole obligation when A offered to
pay. A here cannot get any reimbursement from B since after
all, A did not pay anything to C. To allow the contrary would be
to induce fraud and to countenance partiality.

Art. 1221. If the thing has been lost or if the prestation has

become impossible without the fault of the solidary debtors,

the obligation shall be extinguished.
If there was fault on the part of any one of them, all shall
be responsible to the creditor for the price and the payment
of damages and interest, without prejudice to their action
against the guilty or negligent debtor.
If through a fortuitous event, the thing is lost or the

If in problem (a), the car was lost through the fault of A,
and C makes a demand later upon B, should B be liable
for the price of the car as well as damages or interest?
ANS.: Yes, B will still be liable even if he was not at
fault at all. Remember that a solidary obligation implies
mutual agency and mutual confidence. The law expressly
makes B liable in such a case both for the price of the car
as well as damages or interests, but B can later on recover
from A the whole of what he paid, for had A not been at

COMMENT:
(1) Defenses in Actions Filed

A and B are solidarity obliged to give C this particular
car. The car was lost by a fortuitous event, and without
any fault on the part of the debtors. What happens to the
obligation?

ANS.: The obligation is extinguished. It is essential
here, however, that the debtors be not guilty of default.
(b)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

A, B, and C are solidary debtors of D in an obligation to
give a particular car. D makes an extrajudicial demand
upon A. After the demand, the car was lost by a fortuitous
event. Is the obligation extinguished? If not, what is Us
right?

ANS.: The obligation is not extinguished because the
loss through a fortuitous event occurred after default on
the part of the debtors had arisen. Us right is to exact the
price of the car from any of them. The debtors, however,
who did not have a hand in the default (B and C) have the
right to recover from their co-debtor, A, who after all, was
responsible due to his default.

Those derived from the nature of the obligation (this is a
complete defense).
Examples:

2)

lack of consideration or cause
absolute simulation (as when the contract is totally
fictitious)

3)

illegal consideration
extinguishment of the obligation (as when the whole
debt has been paid., remitted, or has prescribed)

non-fulfillment of the suspensive condition (if made
upon the whole object or upon all the debtors)
6) Statute of Frauds
7) when ALL the debtors were incapacitated to give
consent (such as unemancipated minors, insane,
idiots, persons under a hypnotic spell)
8) when there are VICES OF CONSENT (vitiated
consent) on the part of ALL the debtors (such as when
,
all were forced or intimidated or unduly influenced
or were led into error)
(b) Those personal to the debtor sued. (This is a complete
defense generally , but if the defense is non-fulfillment yet
of a condition or the non-arrival yet of the term, this is only

by B against X for nonpayment of the note, X interposed the
defenses (1) that Y was a minor when the note was executed,
and (2) that B had given an extension of one year to Z. What
are the effects of these defenses?

ANS.: B can recover Pl,000,000 because Vs minority is a
partial defense for X(for Ys share of Pl,000,000). The extension
toZ is also a partial defense for X (for Z’s share of Pl,000,000).

Braganza v. Villa Abrille
L-12471, April 13, 1957

FACTS: On Oct. 20, 1944, Rosario de Braganza and her two
minor sons (18 and 16 years of age) borrowed from Villa Abrille
P70.000 in Japanese money, promising to pay solidarity P10,000
in legal currency of the Philippines two years after the war. The
money was used for the support of the children. For failure to
pay, Villa Abrille sued in March 1949. The mother and the two
sons pleaded in defense the minority of the two children at the
time the contract was entered into.

HELD:
1)

The mother is liable for 1/3 of the P10,000. Reason: The
minority of her children did not completely release her from
liability, since minority is a personal defense of the minors.
She can avail herself of said defense only as regards that
part of the debt for which the minors are liable.

2)

The contract entered into by the minors is voidable, but
since it cannot be denied that they had profited by the
money they received (for their support), it is fair to hold
them liable to the extent of said benefit (computed in
accordance with the Ballantyne scale).

If X sues A, how much will A be liable for?

ANS.: Nothing, for as to him, this is a complete
defense. After all, he would not have been involved
at all, had there been no intimidation.
If X sues B, how much will B be liable for?

ANS.: For the whole P3 million MINUS A’s
share (Pl million) if B puts up A’s vitiated consent
as a defense. Having only a PARTIAL defense, B can
still be held liable for P2 million.

Ouano Arrastre Service, Inc. v.
Aleonor, et al.
GR 97664, Oct. 10, 1991
FACTS: International Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IPI) sued the
Mercantile Insurance Company and Ouano Arrastre Service,
Inc., for replacement of certain equipment imported by IPI which
331

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1222

were insured by Mercantile but were lost on arrival, allegedly
because of mishandling by Ouano. Ouano’s answer was filed
by the law firm of Ledesma, et al. and signed by Atty. Manuel
Trinidad of the Cebu branch of the law office. However, Atty.
Trinidad later resigned from the law firm and Atty. Fidel Manalo,
a partner from the Makati Office filed a motion to postpone the
hearing, stating that the case had just been endorsed to him by
Ouano.

On Jan. 12, 1990, after the trial which Atty. Manalo
handled for Ouano, the trial court held Mercantile and Ouano
jointly and severally liable for the cost of replacement of the
damaged equipment plus damages. Only Mercantile appealed.
On June 19, 1990, IPI moved for execution of the decision
against Ouano which the judge granted on June 25, 1990. On
June 26, 1990, Ouano’s counsel Atty. Catipay filed a notice of
appeal claiming that the decision was “mistakenly sent” by
the trial court to the law firm’s head office in Makati. The trial
judge denied Ouano’s motion, declaring that the appeal cannot
be given due course for lack of merit. The Court of Appeals
(CA) dismissed Ouano’s appeal. Petitioner complains that
an immediate execution, pending Mercantile’s appeal, would
result in “complexities” if the (CA) were to absolve Mercantile
of its liabilities, that Ouano would have no recourse against its
solidary co-debtor and would in effect be held the only one liable
under the trial court’s judgment.

HELD: If that were to happen, Ouano has only itself
to blame. It allowed the period for appeal to lapse without
appealing. Petitioner also argues that under the Civil Code,
a solidary co-debtor can raise the defenses personal to his co¬
debtor and that, therefore, Ouano should be exempt from paying
the portion of the judgment corresponding to Mercantile. The
Supreme Court had rejected a similar claim made to delay
execution of a trial court’s decision. Moreover, Ouano argues
that defenses personal to co-debtors are available to the other
co-debtor because “the rights and liabilities of the parties are so
interwoven and dependent on each other, as to be inseparable,”
i.e., the rights and liabilities to be “interwoven” in their
defenses must be “similar.” Ouano’s and Mercantile’s defenses
actually conflict with each other. Ouano claims that the goods
332

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1228

were received by it from the carrier vessel in bad condition.
Mercantile, upon the other hand, maintains that the goods did
not sustain any damage or loss during the voyage. Furthermore,
Mercantile claims that, in any case, the insurance contract with
IPI has already lapsed, a defense which Ouano, as the arrastre
company responsible for the damage, cannot invoke to avoid
liability. Finally, failing to appeal, Ouano effectively waived
any right it might have had to assert, as against the judgment
creditor, any defense pertaining to Mercantile. In other words,
Ouano by its own act or inaction, is no longer in a position to
benefit from the provisions of Art. 1222.
(5) Effect of Debtor’s Death

X is Ys surety. Creditor sued Y, who died pending the
proceedings. Although the credit must now be brought in the
special settlement proceedings of Fa estate, an ordinary action
filed against X as surety would prosper, the transfer not being
a defense ofX. (See Chinese Chamber of Commerce v. Pua Te

The obligation is converted into a monetary one for
indemnity.

(b)

Example: Mila and Ligaya promised jointly to give a
specific car worth P2,400,000 to Jose. In the meantime,
the car is with Honda Motors Co. Mila’s share is, therefore,
Pl ,200,000. If Mila, because of gambling, does not have
the money, but Ligaya has Pl,200,000, it is clear that they
cannot get the car from Honda Motors Co. So they also
cannot comply with their obligation of delivering the car
to Jose. Here, the obligation to give the car is converted to
a monetary obligation to give P2,400,000 to Jose. Ligaya is
not responsible for Mila’s insolvency, so she is duty bound
to give only Pl,200,000. Mila will be indebted to Jose for
her share of Pl,200,000.

Art. 1224. A joint indivisible obligation gives rise to
indemnity for damages from the time anyone of the debtors
does not comply with his undertaking. The debtors who may
have been ready to fulfill their promises shall not contribute
to the indemnity beyond the corresponding portion of the

obligation consists.

Art. 1225. For the purposes of the preceding articles,
obligations to give definite things and those which are not
susceptible of partial performance shall be deemed to be

indivisible.
When the obligation has for its object the execution of a
certain number of days of work, the accomplishment of work
by metrical units, or analogous things which by their nature
are susceptible of partial performance, it shall be divisible.
335

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1226

However, even though the object or service may be
physically divisible, an obligation is indivisible if so provided
by law or intended by the parties.

In obligations not to do, divisibility or indivisibility shall
be determined by the character of the prestation in each
particular case.

Obligations to give definite things.
(Example: to give this car)

Those which are not susceptible of partial performance.
(Example: to conduct the orchestra in a single
rendition of Buencamino’s “Mayon Concerto”)

(3) Effect of Illegality on a Divisible Contract

In case of a divisible contract, if the illegal terms can be
separated from the legal ones, the latter may be enforced. (Art.
1420, Civil Code; see Angel Jose Warehousing Co., Inc. v. Chelda
Enterprises, L-25704, April 24, 1968)
(4) Cases

Blossom & Co. v. Manila Gas Corp.
55 Phil. 226
FACTS: P and D entered into a contract whereby D will
supply P with gas tar at the price of P65 per ton. The contract
was to run for ten years, to start from the year 1919. D began
delivering but later on he refused to continue. In 1923, P brought
an action for damages against D and asked for damages. P was
awarded damages up to 1923. The judgment became final, and P
did not then ask for more. Later, P brought an action to recover
damages from 1923 to 1929.
ISSUE: Is he allowed to do so?
HELD: No, P is not allowed to recover any more damages.
He should have questioned the judgment before it became final,
but he did not. He had brought the first action to recover damages
for the contract, the whole contract, and because the judgment
in that case had already become final, it cannot be changed
although what he had obtained was only partial recovery. As
a general rule, a contract to do several things at several times
is divisible, and a judgment for a single breach of a continuing
contract is not a bar to a suit for the subsequent breach.

“When the defendant (D) terminated a continuing contract
by absolute refusal in bad faith to perform (absolute, because he
refused not only a single delivery but all subsequent deliveries
Author’s comments), a claim for damages for a breach is an
indivisible demand, and where as in this case, a former final
judgment was rendered, it is a bar to any damages which the
plaintiff may thereafter sustain.”

L. Buck & Son Lumber Co. v. Atlantic Lumber Co.
109 Federal 411
FACTS: A contract was made for the sale of a large quantity
of logs to be delivered in monthly installments during a period of
eight years, payments to be made also in installment, at times
having relations to the deliveries. It contained stipulations as
to such payments, and guaranties as to the average size of the
logs to be delivered in each installment. The seller terminated
the contract for alleged breaches by the buyer and brought suit
for damages, among them payments due for installments of the
logs already delivered. The seller got some damages. Later, he
wanted to recover for the other installments.

ISSUES:
(a)

Is this a divisible or indivisible obligation?

(b)

After recovery has been had of prior installments in a court
action, may another court action prosper for the recovery
of the remaining installments?

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The penalty may be enforced only when it is demandable
in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

COMMENT:
(1) “Penal Clause’ Defined
(a)

It is a coercive means to obtain from the debtor compliance
from the debtor. ( Georg)

(b)

A penal clause is an accessory undertaking to assume
greater liability in case of breach. It is attached to
obligations in order to insure their performance. (8 Manresa
245)

(2) Kinds of Penal Clauses

First classification:

(b)

“This is an indivisible contract, and not a number of
separate and independent agreements for the sale of the
quantity to be delivered and paid for each month, although
there might be breaches of the minor stipulations and
warranties with reference thereto which would warrant
suits with a termination of the contract.”
The later court action for the recovery of the remaining
installments cannot prosper. “The judgment in such action
was conclusive as to all claims or demands of either party
against the other, growing out of the indivisible contract.”
Section 6

OBLIGATIONS WITH A PENAL CLAUSE

Art. 1226. In obligations with a penal clause, the penalty
shall substitute the indemnity for damages and the payment of
interests in case of non-compliance, if there is no stipulation
to the contrary. Nevertheless, damages shall be paid if the
obligor refuses to pay the penalty or is guilty of fraud in the
fulfillment of the obligation.

(3) Penal Clause Distinguished from a Condition

“Between a condition and a penalty, there are notable
differences: the latter constitutes an obligation although
accessory; the former does not. Therefore, the latter may become
demandable in default of the unperformed principal obligation,
and sometimes jointly with it, while the former or the condition
is never demandable.” (Manresa’s Commentaries on the Civil
Code, Vol. 8, p. 244)
(4) Principal Purpose of the Penal Clause

Its principal purpose is to insure the performance of an
obligation and also to substitute for damages and the payment
of interest in case of non-compliance. (Art. 1224, 1st par., Civil
Code)
339

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1226

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(5) Examples

A promised to construct the house of B within 80 days.
In the contract, there is a provision to the effect that for
every day’s delay after the stipulated 80 days, A would pay
a fine or indemnity or penalty of PIO,000. If the house is,
5
therefore, constructed finally at the end of 85 days
A would have to
days more than the time stipulated
pay a penalty of P50.000, i.e., whatever sum B agreed to
give A for the construction of the house will be given to A
minus, of course, the P50,000 imposed as penalty. The first
purpose of the penal clause is, therefore, clear. Its insertion
was to give A a motive to finish the construction on time;
otherwise, he would have to suffer the penalty. The second
purpose is also clear, namely, that instead of computing
the actual damages that may have been caused by the
five days’ delay, and instead of computing the legal rate of
interest as damages, the matter has become simplified by
the insertion of said penal clause, which in this case now
assumes the part of liquidated damages. The general rule
is, therefore, this:The penalty takes the place of indemnity
for damages and the payment of interest.
(b) A stipulation in the contract providing for the compounding
of interest in case of non-performance partakes of the
nature of a penalty clause. If iniquitous or unconscionable,
the interest may be reduced. (Hodges v. Javellana, L-17247,
April 28, 1962)
(c) A stipulation in a contract for the sale of a residential
lot that if within two years from the sale the buyer has
not yet built 50% of his proposed residence, he would pay
Pl1,123 to the seller is an example of a penalty clause.

(6) Exceptions to the General Rule that the Penalty Takes the

Place of Indemnity for Damages and for the Payment of
Interest (stated otherwise, Instances when ADDITIONAL
damages may be recovered):
The exceptions are the following:
(a) When there is express stipulation to the effect that damages
or interest may still be recovered, despite the presence of
the penalty clause;
340

-

Art. 1226

(b)

When the debtor refuses to pay the penalty imposed in the
obligation;

(c)

When the debtor is guilty of fraud or dolo in the fulfillment
of the obligation. The reason for the third exception is clear:
there can be no renunciation of an action to enforce liability
for future fraud because, as we have seen, this is against
public policy and against the express provisions of the law.
[NOTE: Breach of the obligation WITHOUT fraud
cannot constitute one of the exceptions. (Cabarroguis, et
al. v. Vicente, L14304, March 23, I960)]

(7) May Any Penalty Be Demandable?

ANS.: No. The penalty may be enforced only when it is
demandable in accordance with the provisions of the Civil
Code, one of which states that the penalty may be reduced if it
is iniquitous or unconscionable. (Art. 1229, Civil Code)
(8) Cases

Navarro v. Mallari
45 Phil. 242

FACTS: In a building contract, there was stipulation for
a penalty clause. The builder, however, was sued for additional
damages on account of breach of the contract. But the breach
was not occasioned by fraud.
ISSUE: Is the owner entitled to get more damages from
the builder?
HELD: No, he cannot get damages other than what has
been stipulated upon as the penalty or waiver of other damages,
except if otherwise provided by law. A party to a building
contract who is given the benefit of a stipulation fixing a round
sum as liquidated damages for breach of contract on the part
of the builder cannot be awarded additional damages at large
for the same breach. Insistence upon receiving satisfaction of
the penal clause operates as a renunciation of the right to other
damages.

FACTS: In the promissory notes executed by the
defendants, and incorporated in the mortgage deeds, they
voluntarily undertook to pay the sum of Pl,300 as court costs,
expenses of collection, and attorney1s fees, whether incurred or

not.
ISSUE: Is this penal clause valid?
HELD: Yes, this stipulation is valid and permissible penal
clause, not contrary to any law, morals, or public order, and is
therefore, strictly binding upon the defendants. (See Government
of the Philippine Islands v. Lim, 61 Phil. 737; Bachrach v.

Manila Racing Club, Inc. v. Manila Jockey Club
69 Phil. 55
FACTS: A purchaser bought some property in installments.
It was stipulated in the contract that failure to pay any
subsequent installment would forfeit installments already
made. In this case, the purchaser had already paid P100,000
but defaulted in the payment of the other installments. Is the
clause in the contract regarding forfeiture valid?

HELD: Yes, such a clause is valid. It is in the nature
penalty
clause and is not iniquitous or unconscionable,
of a
considering that what has been forfeited amounts only to 8% of
the stipulated price.
“The clause of the contract referring to the forfeiture of
the P100.000 already paid, should the purchaser fail to pay the
subsequent installments, is valid. It is in the nature of a penal
clause which may be legally established by the parties. In its
double purpose of insuring compliance with the contract and of
otherwise measuring before and the damages which may result
from non-compliance, it is not contrary to law, morals, or public
order because it was voluntarily and knowingly agreed upon by
the parties. Viewing concretely the true effects thereof in the
present case, the amount forfeited constitutes only 8% of the
342

Art. 1226

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

stipulated price, which is not excessive if considered as the profit
would have been obtained had the contract been complied with.
There is, moreover, evidence that the defendants had to reject
another proposition to buy the same property. At any rate, the
penal clause does away with the duty to prove the existence and
measure of the damages caused by the breach.”
Nakpil and Sons, et al. v. Court of Appeals
GR 47851, Resolution on

Motion for Reconsideration
FACTS: The promissory note signed by the borrower states
that the loan of P42.050 shall bear interest at the rate of 19%
per annum, and subject to penalty charges equivalent to 2%
per month of any amount due and unpaid. This would yield an
interest of P7,989.50 per annum or a total of P46.339.10 from
November 22, 1978 to September 12, 1984, the date of filing the
complaint.

HELD: Penalty interest of 1% a month or 12% per annum
is reasonable so that from December 12, 1980 to September
12, 1984, penalty charges should be P19,202.83. Considering
that the borrowers have paid the amount of P68.676.75, they
therefore owed the bank the amount of P38.915.18 when the
complaint was filed. There is no indication in the records as to
the fluctuation of actual interest rates from 1984 and, therefore,
the Court orders interest at the legal rate of 12% per annum on
the unpaid amount.
The imposition of 12% pursuant to Central Bank [Bangko
Sentral] Circular 416 (passed pursuant to the authority granted
to the Central Bank (Bangko Sentral) by PD 116 which amended
Act 2655, otherwise known as the Usury Law, is applicable only
in the following: (1) loans; (2) forbearance of any money, goods or
credit; and (3) rate allowed in judgments (judgments spoken of
refer to judgments involving loans or forbearance of any money,
goods or credits).

Country Bankers Insurance Corp. v. Court of Appeals
GR 85161, Sept. 11,1991
FACTS: Lessor Ventanilla and Lessee Sy, entered into a
lease agreement over a theater. The lease was for six years. After
more than two years of the operation of the theaters, Ventanilla
343

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1226

made demands for the repossession of the leased properties
in view of Sy’s arrears in monthly rentals and non-payment
of amusement taxes. In pursuance of their latter agreement,
Sy’s arrears in rental in the amount of P125.445 was reduced
to P71,028. However, the accrued amusement tax liability of
the three theaters to the City Government had accumulated to
P84.000 despite the fact that Sy had been deducting the amount
of P4.000 from his monthly rental with the obligation to remit
the said deductions to the city government. Hence, letters of
demand were sent to Sy demanding payment of the arrears
in rentals and amusement tax delinquency. When Sy failed to
pay the amounts in full, despite demands, Ventanilla padlocked
the gates of the three theaters under lease and took possession
thereof. Sy filed an action for reformation and injunction. By
virtue of the injunction, Sy regained possession of the theater.
The trial court held that Sy is not entitled to reformation. On
the counterclaim, the court found that Ventanilla was deprived
of the enjoyment of the leased premises and suffered damages
as a result of the filing of the case by Sy and his violation of the
terms and conditions of the agreement. It held that Ventanilla
is entitled to recover the damages in addition to the arrears in
rentals and amusement tax delinquency of Sy and the accrued
interest thereon. It found that as of the end of Nov. 1980, when
Ventanilla regained possession of the three theaters, Sy’s unpaid
rentals and amusement tax liability amounted to P289.534.
In addition, it held Sy under obligation to pay PIO,000 every
month from Feb. to Nov. 1980 or the total amount of P100.000
with interest on each amount of P10,000 from the time the
same became due. Thus, P10.000 portion of the monthly lease
rental was supposed to come from the remaining cash deposit
of Sy but with the consequent forfeiture of the remaining cash
deposit of P290.000, there was no more cash deposit from
which said amount could be deducted further. It adjudged Sy
to pay attorney’s fees equivalent to 10% of the amounts above-

HELD: The Supreme Court affirmed the CA’s decision
and held that inasmuch as the forfeiture clause provides that
the deposit shall be deemed forfeited, without prejudice to
any other obligation still owing by the lessee to the lessor, the
penalty cannot substitute for the P100,000 supposed damage
resulting from the issuance of the injunction against the P29,000
remaining cash deposit. This supposed damage suffered by
OVEC was the alleged PIO.OOO a month increase in rental
(from P50,000 to P6O.000), which OVEC failed to realize for ten
months from Feb. to Nov. 1980 in the total sum of P100.000. This
opportunity cost which was duly proven before the trial court,
was correctly made chargeable by the said court against the
injunction bond posted by CISCO. The undertaking assumed by
CISCO under subject inj unction refers to “all such damages as
such party may sustain by reason of the injunction if the Court
should finally decide that the Plaintiff was not entitled thereto."
The CA correctly sustained the trial court in holding that the
bond shall and may answer only for damages which OVEC may
suffer as a result of the injunction. The arrears in rental, the
unremitted amounts of the amusement tax delinquency, the
amount of P100.000 (P10,000 portions of each monthly rental
which were not deducted from plaintiffs cash deposit from Feb.
to Nov. 1980 after the forfeiture of said cash deposit on Feb. 11,
1980) and attorney’s fees which were all charged against Sy
were correct and considered by the CA as damages which OVEC
sustained not as a result of the injunction.

mentioned.

Finally, the court held Sy through the injunction bond
liable to pay P10,000 every month from Feb. to Nov. 1980. The
amount represents the supposed increase in rental from P50,000
to P60,000 in view of the offer of someone to lease the three
theaters involved for P60.000 a month. The Court of Appeals

(2) Example

A promises to finish a certain piece of work within six
months. The contract stipulates that in case he does not build
the house at all, he is supposed to forfeit the sum of Pl,000,000.
In this case, as a general rule the contractor cannot just give
the sum of Pl,000,000 as a substitute for his non-performance
of the obligation. It must be remembered that as a general rule,
therefore, the penal clause is not supposed to substitute the
performance of the principal obligation. He may, however, be
expressly granted by the creditor the right to refrain from the
execution of the contract by a forfeiture of the penalty.

Example: Gloria is obliged to give me either a
particular diamond ring or P700,000.

41 Phil. 523

[NOTE: Here, the choice given to Gloria is absolute.
If, however, the ring is lost by a fortuitous event, she is
still obliged to give me the P700.000.]

FACTS: A lessee rented property from a lessor. The contract
of lease contained a stipulation to the effect that the lessee
should not make any construction on the property without the
permission of the lessor, and that should the lessee do so without
the permission of the lessor said improvements would inure to
the benefit of the estate (lessor) and the lessee, in such a case,
would not have any right to ask for any reimbursement for the
cost of the construction. The lessee made some improvements
without the consent of the lessor. Now, the lessor wants to evict
the lessee for the violation of the conditions of the lease. The
lessee, on the other hand, said that he should not be ousted
because he was ready to forfeit the improvements in favor of
the lessor’s estate.
ISSUE: Is the fact that the lessee is ready to forfeit the
improvement on the estate sufficient to prevent his being ousted
from the premises?
HELD: Even if the lessee is ready to forfeit the
improvements on the estate, he may still be ousted from the
premises for his having violated the condition imposed upon
him, namely, not to make any such improvements without the
permission of the lessor. It is true that the lessee was ready to
fulfill what may perhaps be termed a penalty, but this does not
excuse him from complying with the principal obligation of not
making any improvements without the consent of the lessor. It
must be borne in mind that a debtor (the lessee) cannot escape

Art. 1227. The debtor cannot exempt himself from the
performance of the obligation by paying the penalty, save
in the case where this right has been expressly reserved for
him. Neither can the creditor demand the fulfillment of the
obligation and the satisfaction of the penalty at the same time,
unless this right has been clearly granted him. However, if
after the creditor has decided to require the fulfillment of the
obligation, the performance thereof should become impossible
without his fault, the penalty may be enforced.

COMMENT:
(1) Generally, Debtor Cannot Substitute Penalty for the

Principal Obligation
The general rule is that the debtor is not allowed to just
pay the penalty instead of fulfilling the obligation. He can only
do so if the right has been EXPRESSLY reserved. The reason
is that if he can just pay, fulfillment of the obligation will be
considered an alternative one. The word EXPRESSLY means
that any implied reservation is not allowed.

346

347

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1227

the fulfillment of the obligation by just paying the penalty, unless
such right has expressly been granted him. Hence, everything
considered, the lessee may lawfully be ousted from the premises.
(3) Generally, Creditor Cannot Demand Both Fulfillment

and the Penalty at the Same Time
As a general rule, the creditor does not have this right to
demand fulfillment of the obligation and the penalty at the same
time. The exception arises when such a right has been CLEARLY
granted to him.
[NOTE: In Cabarroguis, et al. v. Vicente, L-14304, March
23, 1960, the Supreme Court held that in obligations for the
payment of a sum of money, when a penalty is stipulated for
default, BOTH the principal obligation and the penalty can be
demanded by the creditor (Government v. Lim, et al., 61 Phil.
737; and Luneta Motor Co. v. Mora, 73 Phil. 80), with interest
on the amount of the penalty from the date of demand, either
judicial or extrajudicial.]

Vitug Dimatulac v. Coronel
40 Phil. 686

FACTS: A sold real property to B with the right of
repurchase. It was agreed in the contract that should A who
was occupying the property in the meantime as lessee default
in the payment of rentals on the property, the right to redeem
would be extinguished. The day came where there was such a
default. B took possession of the property, claiming that her right
as the new owner of the property had already been consolidated
in herself because the seller did not have anymore the right to
repurchase the property. She entered into a compromise with A
regarding the past rentals. B now brings this action to recover
the future rentals, meaning the rentals that should have accrued
from the momentB took possession of the property until the time
originally stipulated upon for the redemption of the property.

ISSUE: Is B allowed to take over the property, thus
consolidating the ownership in her, and at the same time ask
for future rentals?

HELD: No. B is not allowed to have both remedies. The
provision in the contract extinguishing the right of redemption

348

Art. 1227

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

upon the default of the payment of the rentals is in the nature
of a penalty clause. According to the law, the general rule is that
the creditor cannot demand both the performance of the principal
obligation and the forfeiture of the penalty unless such right
has been clearly granted to said creditor. In this case no such
right was granted. It follows, therefore, that the creditor could
not demand both specific performance and the forfeiture of the
penalty. The action of the creditor B in taking possession of the
property fully shows that she was eager to impose the penalty
stipulated upon the contract. She, therefore, has no more right
to insist on the payment of the future rentals. As a matter of
fact, she had no right even to the past rentals, but evidently
the debtor had already waived this by virtue of the compromise
agreed upon between A and B as regard the past rentals.

Navarro v. Mallari
46 Phil. 242
FACTS: The defendant was obliged to construct a chapel
for the plaintiff for P16,000. Of this amount, P12.000 has already
been paid and only P4.000 remains to be paid. The contract
carried a penal clause to the effect that in case of non-compliance
with the obligation, the defendant would have to pay a penalty
of P4.000. It was proved at the trial that the defendant did not
construct the chapel very well did not construct it according
to the specifications of the contract. Hence, Navarro brought
this action to recover P4.000 from Mallari, the defendant, as
penalty. On his part, Navarro refused to pay the balance of
P4.000 which he still owed the defendant. In other words, the
plaintiff Navarro wanted:
(a) to get P4.000 from Mallari as penalty; and

—

(b)

not to pay anymore his (Navarro’s) unpaid balance of

P4.000.
ISSUE: Is Navarro lawfully entitled not to pay his

remaining debt and at the same time ask for the penalty?

HELD: Navarro is really entitled to the penalty because of
the poor construction ofthe chapel but since he still owes P4,000,
what he can get compensates for what he still has to give. Hence,
Navarro cannot really get anything. His debt compensates for
his credit.

Art 1228. Proof of actual damages suffered by the creditor
is not necessary in order that the penalty may be demanded.

COMMENT:
(1) No Necessity of Proving Actual Damages

This Article is a new provision of the New Civil Code.
The penalty may, in the proper case, be demanded without the
necessity of proving actual damages.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1229. The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty
when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly
complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no
performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts
if it is iniquitous or unconscionable.

COMMENT:
(1) When Penalty May Be Reduced by the Court
(a)

When the obligation has been partly complied with by the
debtor. (Partial Performance) (See Makati Development
Corp. v. Empire Insurance Co., L-21780, June 30, 1967)

(b)

When the obligation has been irregularly complied with
by the debtor. (Irregular Performance)

(c)

When the penalty is iniquitous or unconscionable, even if
there has been no performance at all. (Unconscionable or
Iniquitous)

(2) Reason

When a penal clause has been agreed upon in a contract,
more as a punishment for the infraction thereof than a mere
security, it is a lawful means for repairing losses and damages,
and upon evidence of the violation of the conditions stipulated,
the injured party is not obliged to prove losses and damages
suffered, nor the extent of the same in order to demand the
enforcement of the penal clause agreed upon. (Palacios v.
Municipality of Cavite, 12 Phil. 140)

(2) Examples
(a)

A promises to deliver to B 100 bottles of wine on a certain
day when a banquet will be held. The contract states that
failure of A to do so on that day will result in a forfeiture
of P100.000. On that day, A was able to deliver only 90 of
the 100 bottles promised. It is unfair now for B to exact the
payment of the full amount of 100 because here, there has
been partial or irregular performance, and B has in some
way been already benefited by the giving of the 90 bottles
of wine.

(b)

The defendants were able to return only 5 of the 20 rifles
taken by them by virtue of their licenses. The contract
contained a penalty clause or a penal bond which was
supposed to answer for non-delivery. Should the penal
clause be reduced?

Lambert v. Fox
26 Phil. 588

FACTS: A was obliged under a contract with B, not to sell
shares of stock for one year. A penal clause was provided. But
A sold shares of stock within the period specified but damages
were not proved by B to have been suffered by him (B).
ISSUE: May B recover the penalty?

I

HELD: Yes, B may lawfully recover the penalty. “In this
jurisdiction contracts are enforced as they are read, and parties
who are competent to contract may make such agreements
within the limitations of the law and public policy as they desire,
and the courts will enforce them according to their terms. A
penalty imposed for the breach of a contract not to sell shares
of stock for one year will be enforced if the agreement is broken,
no matter whether the person seeking to enforce the penalty has
suffered damages or not.”

350

Art. 1229

ANS.: Yes, the penal bond should be reduced or
mitigated in view of the partial performance. (Insular Gov’t,
v. Punzalan, 7 Phil. 546)
(c)

Supposing in the above-mentioned problem, the defendants
did not help at all in the recovery of the rifles, are they still
entitled to a mitigation of the penal bond?
351

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1229

ANS.: Yes. When some of the lost arms are afterwards
recovered, although the persons responsible for their
safekeeping did not assist in their recovery, the liability
under the bond shall be proportionately reduced. (Insular

(3) Cases

Chua Gui Seng v. General Sales Supply Co., Inc,
91 Phil. 153

FACTS: Plaintiff leased to defendant his premises for a
period of three years. It was also agreed that in addition, in order
to guarantee performance, a deposit of Pl,000 would be made,
said P3,000 to be applied to the monthly rents of P500 for the
last six months (that is, for the 1st two years and six months,
P500 would be collected monthly; but for the remaining six
months, no more rent would be collected in view of the P3,000
already deposited). There was also a stipulation that in case of
non-complotion of the term of three years, the P3.000 would be
forfeited. The tenant then faithfully paid for the first one and
one-half years, but was not able to pay for two months. Plaintiff
now wrote a letter to the defendant, asking:
that the terms of the contract be enforced, with the P3.000
being forfeited;
(b) but stating that if the back rentals (for two months) would
be paid within 15 days, the deposit of P3,000 would not be
forfeited.
Upon receiving the letter of demand, the defendant left the
premises without paying the two months rental, on the belief
that this could be charged to the P3,000 deposit.

FACTS: A building was leased, with an advance payment
of P6,000. It was provided in the contract that if the tenant
defaults in the payment of the monthly rent, the contract will
be automatically cancelled, and “at the same time, a right of
confiscation is granted the lessor of the lessee’s advance payment
as damages.”

ISSUE: Is the stipulation valid?
HELD: The stipulation is a penalty clause, and even if
iniquitous or unconscionable, in a sense, it is not void, but subject
merely to equitable reduction. Moreover, the amount that can
be recovered is not limited merely to actual or compensatory
damages.

Umall v. Miclat
L-9262, July 10, 1959

(a)

ISSUE: Should the entire P3.000 be forfeited?
HELD: No, it is not proper that the entire P3,000 be
forfeited for, after all, the lease had already existed for more
than half of the period stipulated. Half of P3.000 may, however,
be forfeited. It is unjust for the whole amount to be forfeited
considering, aside from the partial performance, the following
factors:
(a) The landlord could look for another tenant after the 15-day
period of grace.

Art 1229

If the penalty clause is unreasonable, as when it provided
for a surcharge of 10% every 30 days in case of failure to
fulfill the obligation, equity demands that the same be
REDUCED in fairness to the obligor. A surcharge of 20%
per annum would, however, be reasonable.
(b) If in addition to the surcharge as penalty, the contract also
provides that damages may be recovered, said stipulation
as to damages would be all right, and should be computed
on the basis of 6% per annum, the obligation being
monetary in character. Article 1226 expressly allows a
stipulation as to damages, in addition to the penalty.

viewpoint, if both parties committed a breach of a reciprocal

such additional rate partakes of the nature of a penalty

of the penal clause.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Nullity of the Penalty Clause

Commercial Credit Corp, of Cagayan
de Oro v. Court of Appeals and the Cagayan
de Oro Coliseum, Inc.
GR 78315, Jan. 2, 1989

If the principal obligation is null and void, the penal
clause will have no more use for existence and is therefore also
considered null and void. Upon the other hand, just because the
penal clause is not valid, it does not mean that its nullity will
also make the principal obligation null and void. Reason: The
principal obligation can stand alone, and the void penal clause
will just be disregarded.

Article 1229 of the Civil Code applies only to an
obligation or contract, subject of a litigation, the condition
being that the same has been partly or irregularly complied
with by the debtor. Said proviso also applies even if
there has been no performance, as long as the penalty is
iniquitous or unconscionable. It cannot apply to a final and
executory judgment.
When the parties entered into the compromise
agreement and submitted the same for the approval of the
trial court, its terms and conditions must be the primordial
consideration why the parties voluntarily entered into the
same. The trial court approved it because it is lawful, and
is not against public policy or morals. Even the respondent
Court of Appeals upheld the validity of the said compromise
agreement. Hence, the respondent court has no authority
to reduce the penalty and attorney’s fees therein stipulated
which is the law between the parties and is res judicata.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue
v. William J. Suter &
the Court of Tax Appeals
L-25532, Feb. 28, 1969
FACTS: A limited partnership named “William J. Suter
‘Morcoin’ Co., Ltd.” was formed on Sept. 30, 1947 by William
J. Suter as general partner (one liable even beyond his
contribution), and Julia Spirig and Gustav Carlson, as limited
partners (those liable only to the extent of their contributions).
In 1948, Suter and Spirig got married, and sometime later,
Carlson sold his share in the partnership to Suter and his wife.

Art 1231

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ISSUE: Did the marriage dissolve or put an end to the
partnership?
HELD: No, the marriage did not dissolve the partnership.
While spouses cannot enter into a universal partnership, they
can enter into a particular partnership or be members thereof.
The contract was not, therefore, ended.
Lamberto Torrijos v. Court of Appeals
'
L-40336, Oct. 24, 1975
FACTS: In 1964, Torrijos purchased a lot from Diamnuan.
Later Torrijos learned that in 1969 Diamnuan sold the same lot
to De Guia. Torrijos initiated an estafa complaint against the
seller, who was convicted. During the appeal in the Court of
Appeals, the accused Diamnuan died. His lawyer filed a motion
to dismiss alleging that the death of his client, prior to final
judgment, extinguished both the personal and the pecuniary
penalties.
ISSUE: Is the civil liability also extinguished?
HELD: The civil liability here is not extinguished, because
independently of the criminal case, the accused was civilly liable
to Torrijos. If after receiving the purchase price from Torrijos, he
failed to deliver the property (even before selling it again to De
Guia), there would as yet be no estafa, but there is no question of
his civil liability through an action by Torrijos either for specific
performance plus damages or rescission plus damages. Death
is not a valid cause for the extinguishment of a civil obligation.
Had the only basis been the commission of estafa, it is clear that
the extinguishment of the criminal responsibility would also
extinguish the civil liability, provided that death comes before
final judgment. Furthermore, under Arts. 19, 20, and 21 of the
Civil Code, the accused would be civilly liable independently of
the criminal liability for which he can be held liable. And this
civil liability exists despite death prior to final judgment of
conviction.

her household bills was without her knowledge or against
her will, she cannot deny the fact that the same still in¬
ured to her benefit and Encomienda must, therefore, be
consequently reimbursed for it.”

Art. 1233

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(3) Acceptance by Creditor

For payment to properly exist, the creditor has to accept
the same, expressly or implicitly. Payment, for valid reasons,
may properly be rejected. (TS, May 18, 1943)
(4) Effect of Payment Made Under a Void Judgment

If the judgment upon which the aggrieved party made
payment is null and void, the payment made thereunder is also
null and void. (Manila Surety and Fidelity Co. v. Lim, L-9343,
Dec. 29, 1959)

Art. 1233. A debt shall not be understood to have been paid
unless the thing or service in which the obligation consists
has been completely delivered or rendered, as the case may
be.

COMMENT:
(1) Completeness of Payment
Requisites for a valid payment under this Article:
(a) The very thing or service contemplated must be paid.
(b) Fulfillment must be complete. (Ramos v. Ledesma, 12 Phil.
656)

(2) How Payment or Performance Is Made

(2) Pre-existing Obligation

A person pays a pre-existing obligation. If no such obligation
exists, strictly speaking there is no payment.
Example:

A was given the option to buy a car or not, within the period
of one week. Here, A has no duty to buy. But if he decides to
buy, an obligation is created and he must pay. (See Asturias
Central v. Pure Cane Molasses Co., 60 Phil. 259, where it was
held that a “payment” made because of a reserved right or option
or privilege is not governed by Arts. 1232 to 1262, because such
“payment” cannot be demanded by the creditor.)

360

(a)

If the debt is a monetary obligation, by delivery of the
money. The amount paid must be full, unless of course
otherwise stipulated in the contract.

[NOTE: The term “indebtedness" has been defined
as an unconditional and legally enforceable obligation
for the payment of money. (Commissioner of Int. Rev. u.
Prieto, L- 13912, Sept. 30, 1960) Within that definition, it is
apparent that a tax may be considered as an indebtedness.
(See Sambrano v. Court of Tax Appeals, et al., 53 O.G.
4839)]
(b) If the debt is the delivery of a thing or things, by delivery
of the thing or things.
361

Art. 1233

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(c)

If the debt is the doing of a personal undertaking, by the
performance of said personal undertaking.

(d)

If the debt is not doing of something, by refraining from
doing the action.

(3) Burden of Proof

'

(a)

An alleged creditor has the burden of showing that a valid
debt exists.

(b)

Once he does this, the debtor has the burden of proving
that he has paid the same. (Lopez v. Tan Tioco, 8 Phil.
693) Thus, if a promissory note is still in the creditor’s
possession, the presumption is that it has not yet been
paid. (Bantug v. del Rosario, 11 Phil. 511)
In Bognot v. RRI Lending Corp. (736 SCRA 357
[2014]), the Supreme Court explained that once the indebt¬
edness has been established, the burden of proof is on the
debtor to prove payment. (KT Construction Supply, Inc. v.
Phil. Savings Bank, 828 SCRA 211 [2017])

(4) Means of Proving Payment

One good proof is the presentation of the receipt. (Toribio
v. Fox, 34 Phil. 913) A debtor is justified in demanding that a
creditor issue a receipt when the debt is paid. (TS, Jan. 5, 1911;
see Art. 1256, Civil Code)
Javier v. Brinas
(CA.) 40 O.G. 4th Supp. No. 8, p. 279

FACTS: A borrowed money from B, the debt to be paid
in installments. There were several receipts, each of which
acknowledged the payment of a certain installment. B brought
an action against A for installments not covered by receipts. A’s
defense was that he had paid the whole debt but that he could
not show all the receipts for all the installments because there
were instances when in his dealings with the creditor, no receipt
was issued in his favor.
ISSUE: Is A’s testimony sufficient to establish or prove the
fact that the whole debt had been paid?
362

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1234

HELD: No, his testimony does not constitute sufficient
proof that the entire debt has been paid. His testimony is in
fact incompatible with the usual procedure between him and B,
the creditor, as evidenced by the fact that in their transactions,
receipts were issued.
[NOTE: It must be recalled at this stage, however, that a
receipt for a later installment establishes the presumption that
prior or previous installments have been paid or discharged.]
(5) In a usury case, it has been held that the mere fact that the
interest is usurious does not necessarily mean that the loan
is void. After all, the loan itself is the principal contract. The

stipulation regarding interest may be regarded as merely
accessory. The principal of the loan must still be paid, otherwise
it remains unpaid.

Gui Jong & Co. v. Rivera and Avellar
45 Phil. 778
FACTS: Rivera borrowed money from Gui Jong and Co. at a
usurious rate, secured by a mortgage. When asked for payment,
he said that his obligation has been extinguished because the

contract is usurious.
ISSUE: Is he correct? If the lender now desires to foreclose,
may he do so?
HELD: The obligation to pay the principal (and the lawful
interest) has not been extinguished and in case of non-payment
thereof, foreclosure is proper.
Art. 1234. If the obligation has been substantially
performed in good faith, the obligor may recover as though
there has been strict and complete fulfillment, less damages
suffered by the obligee.

COMMENT:
(1) Substantial Performance in Good Faith
(a) The above rule (Art. 1234) is adopted from American Law.
Its fairness is evident. In case of substantial performance,
the obligee is benefited. So the obligor should be allowed
363

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1234

to recover as if there had been a strict and complete
fulfillment, less damages suffered by the obligee. This
last condition affords a just compensation for the relative
breach committed by the obligor. (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 131)

It must be noted that the liability of the debtor for damages
suffered by the creditor in case of substantial performance
does not arise under the conditions set forth in Art. 1235
of the Civil Code.
(c) Inasmuch as substantial performance in good faith may
already be equivalent to “fulfillment” or “payment,” it
follows that the right to rescind (mentioned in Art. 1191)
cannot be used simply because there have been slight
breaches of the obligation. In fact, such right to rescind is
not absolute, and therefore the Court may even grant, at
its discretion, a period to a person in default, within which
the obligation can be fulfilled. (See Gaboya v.Cui, L-19614,
March 27, 1971)
(b)

Rosete, et al. v. Perober Dev. Corp.
CA-GR 61032-R
July 31, 1981
Substantial performance or compliance is, in a sense, a
performance according to the fair intent of the contract, with
an attempt in good faith to perform.

Fair dealing and equity demand a faithful compliance of
one’s contractual obligations.
(2) When Is Art. 1234 Applicable?

Said provision applies only when an obligor admits
breaching the contract after honestly and faithfully performing
all the material elements thereof except for some technical
aspects that cause no serious harm to the obliges. (International
Hotel Corp. v. Joaquin, Jr., 695 SCRA 382)

Note that the determination of the existence of a breach of
contract is a factual matter not usually reviewable in a petition
filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1236

Art. 1235. When the obligee accepts the performance,
knowing its incompleteness or irregularity, and without
expressing any protest or objection, the obligation is deemed
fully complied with.

COMMENT:
(1) Estoppel on the Creditor’s Part in View of His Acceptance

Reason for the Article: The presence of WAIVER and
ESTOPPEL.
(2) Qualified Acceptance

Note that under this Article, there is a possibility that a
protest or objection can be made. Hence, there is what is called
“qualified acceptance of incomplete or irregular payment.” Be
it remembered that a creditor who gives a receipt for a partial
payment does not necessarily acquiesce to such incomplete
payment. His actuations may show his dissatisfaction. (Esguerra
v. Villanueva, L-23191, Dec. 19, 1967) Thus, a creditor may
conditionally accept performance by the debtor after the time
of maturity, but with the stipulation that the surety or the
guarantor of the debtor should give CONSENT. This is to
prevent the surety or guarantor from later on alleging that the
creditor had given an extension of time to the debtor. In this way,
the surety or guarantor cannot claim that he has been released
from the obligation. (Joe's Electrical Supply v. Alto Electronic
Corp., L12376, Aug. 22, 1958)
(3) Case

Constante Amor de Castro v. Court of Appeals
GR 115838, July 18, 2002
The word “accept,” as used in Art. 1235 of the Civil
Code, means to take a satisfactory or sufficient, or agree to an
incomplete or irregular performance.
In the case at bar, the mere receipt of a partial payment
is not equivalent to the required acceptance of performance as
would extinguish the whole obligation.
365

364

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1236

Art. 1236. The creditor is not bound to accept payment
or performance by a third person who has no interest in the
fulfillment of the obligation, unless there is a stipulation to
the contrary.
Whoever pays for another may demand from the debtor
what he has paid, except that if he paid without the knowledge
or against the will of the debtor, he can recover only insofar
as the payment has been beneficial to the debtor.

(3) Observation of Justice J.B.L. Reyes

No good reason exists for departing from the rule of the
Spanish Code (Art. 1158) that payment may be made by a
stranger where the obligation is not intuitu personae. Such rule
(Art. 1158, old Code) is justified by:
(a) the existence of the quasi-contract of negotiorum gestio of
which payment for another is but a variant; and
(b)

COMMENT:
(1) Right of Creditor to Refuse Payment by Third Person

The creditor can refuse payment by a stranger (3rd person)
except:
(a) if there is a stipulation allowing this;
(b)

or if said third person has an interest in the fulfillment of
the obligation (co-debtor, guarantor, even a joint debtor).
(Monte de Piedad v. Rodrigo, 63 Phil. 312)

(2) Comment of the Code Commission

What is the reason of the Code Commission in recommending
that the creditor should not be compelled “to accept payment
or performance by a third person who has no interest in the
fulfillment of the obligation, unless there is stipulation to the
contrary”?
ANS.: “Under the old Civil Code, the creditor cannot refuse
payment by a third person but the Commission believes that
the creditor should have a right to insist on the liability of the
debtor. Moreover, the creditor should not be compelled to accept
payment from a third person whom he may dislike or distrust.
The creditor may not, for personal reasons, desire to have any
business dealings with a third person; or the creditor may not
have confidence in the honesty of the third person who might
deliver a defective thing or pay with a check which may be
honored." (Report of the Code Commission, p. 132)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the evolution of the concept of ordinary obligation from a
relation of person to person (as it was in Roman Law), to
a relation of patrimony to patrimony in the modern law.
Where no personal qualities are involved, what interest
does the creditor have in seeing that the performance
should be by A or B? As for the debtor, he is protected by
the second paragraph of Art. 1236, and by Art. 1237. The
first paragraph of Art. 1236 should be eliminated. (Quoted
in Tolentino, Civil Code, Vol. 4, p. 246).

(4) Payment by a Third Person (BAR)

The third person may pay:

with the knowledge and consent of the debtor. (Here,
the payor is entitled to REIMBURSEMENT and
SUBROGATION to such rights as guaranty, penalty clause,
or mortgage.) (See Art. 1237; see also De Guzman v. Santos,
68 Phil. 371)
(b) without the debtor’s knowledge or against his will. (Here,
the payor is not entitled to subrogation; moreover, he is
allowed only BENEFICIAL REIMBURSEMENT.)
Example: IfX pays for Ps transportation fare, without
Ps knowledge, or against Ys will, and later discovers that
Y was entitled to HALF-FARE, X can recover only said half¬
fare, even if he had paid the FULL FARE. This is clearly
the fault of X.
[NOTE: In the example given, can X recover Y s half¬
fare from the creditor?
HELD: No, for this is not solutio indebiti (for said
half-fare was really due). Xs right is against Y, the debtor,

(a)

367

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1236

for said half-fare. (See Bank of P.I. v. Trinidad, 42 Phil.
223; and Monte de Piedad v. Fernando Rodrigo, 63 Phil.
312) The remaining half-fare, which was NOT even due the
creditor, is of course undue payment or solutio indebiti and
may properly be recovered from the creditor. (8 Manresa
270)]
[NOTE: Other instances when recovery can be had
from the creditor and not from the innocent debtor:
a) when the debt had prescribed
b)

c)
d)

when the debt had been completely remitted
when the debt has already been paid
when legal compensation had already taken place. (8
Manresa 270)]

Example:

A owes B Pl,000,000. Later, A paid B P700.000,
leaving a balance of P300.000. C, a classmate of A, and
intending to surprise A, paid B the sum of Pl,000,000
thinking that A still owed B that amount. He did this
without knowledge of A. How much can C recover from A?

ANS.: C can recover only P300,000 from A, because
it is only up to this amount that A has been benefited. C
can recover the remaining P700.000 from B who should
not have accepted complete payment for a debt already
partially paid. If B incidentally is in bad faith, B is
responsible not only for the return of the P700.000 but also
for the interest in lieu of damages.
In the preceding problem, suppose the payment by C
had been made against the will of A, would your answer
be the same?
ANS.: Yes, the answer would be the same. The law
makes no distinction as to the right of recovery in case
payment by a stranger was made either without the
knowlege or against the consent of the debtor. In both
cases, the paying stranger “can recover only insofar as the
payment has been beneficial to the debtor.” (Art. 1236, 2nd
paragraph, Civil Code)

Agoncillo v. Javier
38 Phil. 424

FACTS: D owes C. Without Us knowledge, X, a friend,
paid C part of Us debt. So, D still owes the remainder. Does
Xs payment of part of the debt prevent the running of the
prescriptive period regarding the remaining part?
HELD: No, because in no way may D be said to have
acknowledged the existence of the debt.
Gonzaga v. Garcia
27 Phil. 7

FACTS: Francisco sold a parcel of land a retro to somebody.
In the registry records, the right to repurchase was therefor
annotated. Francisco sold later this right of repurchase to Del
Rosario who in turn sold the same to Gonzaga. Francisco later
paid on his own behalf the repurchase money to the buyer a
retro, and the annotation of the right to redeem in the Registry
of Property was cancelled. Gonzaga now seeks to have the land
registered under his name on the theory that Francisco had paid
for his (Gonzaga’s) “debt,” and therefore the land now properly
belongs to him (Gonzaga).
HELD: Petition of Gonzaga will not prosper, because Art.
1236, being applicable only to “debts,” cannot be used in this
case. Gonzaga was not a true debtor. While Gonzaga had the
right to repurchase, such right was only a right, not a duty. In
a true debt, there is a duty. In a case of the right to repurchase,
whether or not the property would be repurchased depends
entirely on Gonzaga. Therefore, Francisco’s act of repurchasing
did not make Del Rosario or his transferee, Gonzaga, the owner,
cannot have the land registered under his name.
[NOTE: Had Francisco acted as agent for Gonzaga, or had
Francisco’s act been a case of negotiorum gestio, the answer
would have been different. (See Sison v. Balgos, 34 Phil. 885,
where the Court held that an uncle of certain wards, whether
appointed legal guardian for them or not, is allowed under the
law to repurchase or redeem property in behalf of the minors,
inasmuch as even a third person, who is a complete stranger ,
may pay for someone under Art. 1236)]

Mitsui Bussan Kaisha v. Meralco
39 Phil. 624

FACTS: Plaintiff, a seller in Japan, sold to defendant,
a buyer, some coal. While delivery was being made, the Phil.
Legislature imposed a specific tax of Pl.00 per metric ton of
coal. So that the coal could enter Manila, the plaintiff paid this
tax. When defendant was asked for reimbursement, defendant
refused to pay. Hence, plaintiff brought this action.
ISSUES: 1)
2)

Who should really pay the tax?
If buyer should really pay the tax, may
seller recover from the buyer what has
been paid for the taxes, even though said
payment was effected without the consent
of the buyer?

HELD: (1) The buyer should really pay the tax. Although
the Act provides that the seller may pay the tax, as is practiced
under our revenue system, still the ultimate liability should fall
upon the buyer.

Since the seller, therefore, merely paid in behalf of the
buyer, the seller can now recover the tax paid from the buyer,
notwithstanding the fact that the buyer’s consent had not been
previously obtained. What can be recovered is that amount which
has benefited the buyer (debtor of the tax), and in this case, the
amount of benefit was clearly the whole tax.

the debt is already paid, and as creditor, he now steps out of the
picture. Moreover, only the debtor’s rights are affected.
2) Once the creditor has accepted payment from a stranger, it

cannot later on require the permission of the debtor to the
payment.
3) Here also, the Supreme Court said that if the stranger pays

with the knowledge of the debtor who keeps quiet and does not
object, it is as if the debtor had really consented. The debtor is
not allowed to protest long after the payment. His conduct at
the time of payment is what counts.
[NOTE: The knowledge of the debtor that someone is
paying for him can be proved inferentially and by his conduct.

Chonney Lim v. Court of Appeals, Lea
Castro Whelan & Keith Lawrence Whelan
GR 104819-20, July 20, 1998

The payment of the loan and capital gains tax undoubtedly
relieved the appellant from such obligations. The benefit had
even been mutual, both appellant and appellee had obtained
the appellant from his loan, and
advantages on their sides
appellee from being secured of the possession.

—

This Court finds no error in ruling that petitioner Lim is
not entitled to rescission of the contract. It cannot be denied
that Chonney Lim is also not without fault in this case. It was
Lim’s obligation to see to it that the property was free from all
encumbrances and tax liabilities, inter alia, which he obviously
failed to do. The respondent court’s ruling in considering the
payment of the mortgage loan and the capital gains tax by
Lea Whelan as her full payment for the property is but a fair
disposition which this Court does not see any cogent reason to
reverse.

1) As to whether or not payment by a third person really benefited

Art. 1237

COMMENT:
(1) When No Subrogation Exists
This Article is an amendment of Art. 1159 of the old Civil
Code. Under the article of the old Civil Code, no mention was
made in case the payor paid against the will of the debtor.
Furthermore, no examples of subrogation were made. The
amendment, however, does not effect any radical change in the
law inasmuch as even under the old Civil Code, our jurisprudence
has ruled that one who pays without the knowledge of the debtor
has no right to subrogation. Hence, with less reason should a
payor against the will of the debtor be entitled to subrogation.
Under the old Civil Code too, the concept of subrogation and the
rights it carried were well known; hence, the New Civil Code
article in this respect has not made any substantial change.

Subrogation means the act of putting somebody into the
shoes of the creditor, hence, enabling the former to exercise
all the rights and actions that could have been exercised by
the latter. The law says: “Subrogation transfers to the person
subrogated the credit with all the rights thereto appertaining,
either against the debtor or against third persons, be they
guarantors or possessors of mortgages, subject to stipulation in
a conventional subrogation.” (Art. 1303, Civil Code)

Subrogated in the Place of the Creditor
The rights arising from:
(a)
(b)
(c)

a mortgage;
a guaranty;
a penalty or penal clause.

(4) Problems
(a)

A borrowed Pl million from B. The loan was secured by a
mortgage of A's land in favor of B . Without the knowledge of
A, C paid B the sum of Pl million for A’s debt. A benefited
to the amount of Pl million.
1)
May C claim reimbursement from A?

If so, how much?
If A cannot pay, may C foreclose the mortgage on A’s
land?

ANS.:

(2) “Subrogation’ Defined

(3) Some Rights Which May Be Exercised by the Person

Art. 1237

Yes, C can claim reimbursement from A inasmuch as
C paid A’s debt.
C can recover the whole amount of Pl million
inasmuch as the problem states that A benefited up
to the amount of Pl million.
If A cannot pay, C cannot foreclose the mortgage on
A’s land. It is true that the original creditor B had
the right to foreclose in case of non-payment, BUT in
this case, the new creditor C had not been subrogated
in the rights of B, inasmuch as C paid without the
knowledge of A. The only right of C therefore is
reimbursement up to the amount A had benefited,
but NOT the right of subrogation. “Whoever pays on
behalf of the debtor without the knowledge or against
the will of the latter, cannot compel the creditor to
subrogate him in his rights, such as those arising
from a mortgage, etc.” (Art. 1237, Civil Code)
[NOTE: If in problem (a), C had paid A’s debt
against the will of A, would your answer be the same?

ANS.: Yes, the answer would be the same,
inasmuch as the law gives the same rights to one
who pays without the knowledge and to one who pays
against the will of the debtor. (Art. 1237, Civil Code)]
(b) A owes B the sum of Pl million. C is the guarantor of A. A
was able to pay B the sum of P400.000. Therefore, P600,000
still remains unpaid. D, thinking that A still owed B
Pl million paid Pl million to B, against the will of A.
1)
May D recover from A?

If so, how much?

3)

If A cannot pay, may D proceed against the guarantor

C?
373

372

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1237

ANS.:
1)

Yea, D may recover from A.

2)

D can recover only P600.000 because this is the only
amount which benefited A. Remember that previously
P4O0.O00 had been paid, leaving a balance of merely

P600.000.

3)

If A cannot pay, D cannot ordinarily proceed against
the guarantor C because D, having paid against the
will of A, is not entitled to subrogation.

on the scene. In reimbursement, the new creditor has different
rights, so it is as if there has indeed been an extinguishment of
the obligation.

In subrogation, there is something more than a personal
action of recovery; in reimbursement, there is only a personal
action to recover the amount. (8 Manresa 269)
(7) Similarity

Note, however, that in both reimbursement and
subrogation, there can be recovery of what the stranger "has
paid’ (not necessarily the amount of the credit). (See Art. 1236,
2nd par., Civil Code)

Suppose a payor pays the creditor with the express or
implied consent of the debtor, what are the rights of the
payor?
ANS.: A payor in this case would be entitled not
merely to full reimbursement but also to subrogation, or
the right to bring actions against the debtor as mortgagee
or against third persons.

Art. 1238. Payment made by a third person who does
not intend to be reimbursed by the debtor is deemed to be
a donation, which requires the debtor’s consent. But the
payment is in any case valid as to the creditor who has
accepted it.

Is there any specific provision of the law supporting the
answer in (a)?
ANS.: Yes. Article 1302 of the Civil Code states that:
“It is presumed that there is legal subrogation x x x (2)

COMMENT:
(1) When Payment by Stranger Is Deemed a Donation
Reason why debtor has to consent No one should be
compelled to accept the generosity of another. (Report of the
Code Commission, p. 132)

when a third person, not interested in the obligation, pays
with the express or tacit approval of the debtor.”
Article 1237 says, the payor “cannot compel the creditor,
“but this is NOT the meaning of the law, for subrogation
can take place only if the payment had been made with the
knowledge and without the objection of the debtor. What
the law, therefore, means is that such payor as is referred
to in Art. 1237 “is not entitled to subrogation.”

(6) ‘Subrogation’ Distinguished from ‘Reimbursement’

In subrogation, recourse can be had to the mortgage or
guaranty or pledge; in reimbursement, there is no such recourse.
In subrogation, the debt is extinguished in one sense, but a
new creditor, with exactly the same rights as the old one, appears

—

(2) Example

A owes B Pl million. C, in behalf of A, pays B Pl million
against the consent of A, although C had previously told A that he
(C) did not intend to be reimbursed. Needless to say, B accepted
the payment by C in behalf of A.

Is A’s obligation towards B extinguished?
(b) May C still recover from A, because of the fact that A did
not consent to what the law deems a donation on the part
ofCin favor of A?

(a)

ANS.:
(a) Yes, A’s obligation toward B is extinguished even if A did
not consent to the donation. The law says: “But the payment
376

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1239

is in any case valid as to the creditor who has accepted it.”

(2nd sentence, Art. 1238, Civil Code)
(b)

'

Yes, C may still recover from A, although originally C did
not intend to be reimbursed. This is so because here there
has been no real donation. However, inasmuch as the
payment by C had been effected against the will of A, all
that C can recover from A is to the extent that A has been
benefited by Cs payment to B in A’s behalf.

Art. 1239. In obligations to give, payment made by one
who does not have the free disposal of the thing due and
capacity to alienate it shall not be valid, without prejudice
to the provisions of Article 1427 under the Title on “Natural
Obligations.”

COMMENT:

ANS.: The parents can recover only P200.000 inasmuch as

incapacitated person, Art. 1241 refers to payment to an

If person paying has no capacity to give:
(a) payment is not valid
if accepted;
(b) creditor cannot even be compelled to accept it;
(c) the remedy of consignation would not be proper. (8 Manresa

to the person in whose favor the obligation has been

constituted (the creditor);

payment, not the original creditor at the time the obligation
was constituted. (Tuason and San Pedro v. Zamora and
Sons, 2 Phil. 305)]

Exception (as provided for in Art. 1427, Civil Code)-.
“When a minor between eighteen and twenty-one years of
age, who has entered into a contract without the consent of the
parents or guardian voluntarily pays a sum of money or delivers
a fungible thing in fulfillment of the obligation, there shall be
no right to recover the same from the obligee who has spent or
consumed it in good faith.”
(2) Example of the Exception

A, a minor, entered into a contract without the consent of
his parents. In said contract, A was supposed to pay to B the
sum of Pl million. B did not know of A's minority, and when
A voluntarily paid him the money, B accepted the sum. Out of
this amount, B spent P800.000. Later, the parents of A learned
of the transaction, and brought an action in court to recover the

(2) Cases

Harry E. Keeler Electric Co. v. Rodriguez
44 Phil. 19

FACTS: Rodriguez owed the company a certain amount
money.
One Montelibano approached Rodriguez and claimed
of
377

376

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1240

that he (Montelibano) was duly authorized to receive payment for
the company. Without making any verification, Rodriguez paid
Montelibano. Later, the company sued Rodriguez for payment
of debt. Rodriguez presented the defense that he had already
paid his debt to Montelibano who was not authorized to receive
payment.

ISSUE: Should Rodriguez still pay his debt to the company?
HELD: Yes. Rodriguez’s payment to Montelibano was not
valid because Montelibano was not duly authorized to receive
such payment. Payment to an unauthorized agent is at the risk
of the payor. Rodriguez should have made a proper verification.
Ormachea v. Trillana
13 Phil. 194

FACTS: Plaintiff was formerly a member of a partnership,
and upon dissolution of said partnership, he was given the
right to collect the debts due the partnership. Plaintiff sued
the defendant. Defendant presented a note signed by Lawa,
the former administrator of the partnership, to the effect that
defendant’s debt had already been extinguished. However, the
vales still remained in the possession of the plaintiff.
ISSUES:

2)

What is the value of the vales being still in the hands of
the plaintiff?
Was Lawa authorized to say that the obligation of the
defendant was extinguished, even if at that time Lawa
was no longer the administrator of the partnership (which
incidentally has already been dissolved)?

3)

Should the defendant pay the plaintiff?

1)

HELD:
1)

The vales still in the hands of the plaintiff constitute a
presumption that the debt of the defendant has not yet
been paid.

2)

Lawa was not authorized to say that the obligation of the
defendant was extinguished because Lawa was at that
time no longer authorized to receive payments in behalf
378

Art. 1240

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

of the partnership. Had he been duly authorized to do so,
this fact would have rebutted the presumption regarding
the non-payment of the debt, and would have extinguished
the debt inasmuch as presumably it had been paid to one
authorized to receive the payment.
3)

Yes, the defendant should pay the plaintiff because the
defendant has not succeeded in proving that his debt has
been paid.

Crisol v. Claveron
38 O.G. No. 156, p. 3734

FACTS: Crisol was the creditor of Claveron. When Crisol’s
first wife died, he distributed the property among his children.
Later Crisol married again. After Crisol’s death the children
asked Claveron to pay them his debt. Claveron instead paid the
second wife, who was declared unauthorized by the court.
ISSUE: Is Claveron’s debt extinguished?
HELD: No, Claveron’s debt is not extinguished because the
person to whom he had made the payment was not authorized
to receive it. Besides, the heirs of Crisol had already made
a demand upon Claveron, yet Claveron refused to heed said
demand. He must now pay for his stubbornness.
(3) Payment Made to Authorized Entities

Payment made to entities authorized by an occupation
government (like the Japanese occupation government in the
Philippines) of debts in favor of enemy persons and corporations,
should be considered as valid, because a belligerent military
occupant has the right under International Law to sequester
or freeze the assets of the enemy. (Haw Pia v. China Banking
Corp., 80 Phil. 604)

Haw Pia v. China Banking Corporation
80 Phil. 604
FACTS: Haw Pia owed defendant a sum of money
(Philippine pesos) secured by a mortgage. During the Japanese
occupation, the Bank of Taiwan was given the right by the
379

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHIUPPINES

Art 1240

Military Administration to liquidate the assets of enemy banks.
Haw Pia then paid off the mortgage, not to the defendant, but
to the Bank of Taiwan. Liberation came. Haw Pia is now asking
for the cancellation of the mortgage on the ground that it had
been paid. The defendant refused, and on the contrary asked
for payment of the debt.

ISSUES:
(a)

Had the Japanese Military Administration the right to
liquidate and freeze the assets of enemy banks?

(b)

Did payment by Haw Pia to the Bank of Taiwan
extinguished the debt?

(c)

Was Japanese money then legal tender?

HELD:
(a)

Yes, the Japanese Military Administration, under the
principles of international law, had the right to liquidate
and freeze the assets of enemy banks What it did was not
confiscation, but merely liquidation so as to freeze assets.

(b)

Yes, payments by Haw Pia to the Bank of Taiwan
extinguished the mortgage debt, inasmuch as under the
law then prevailing, the Rank of Taiwan was authorized to
receive payment. Hence, the mortgage should be cancelled.

(c)

Yes, the Japanese Military notes was legal tender because
under International Law, the invading power has the right
to issue currency for circulation here.

SUBSIDIARY ISSUE: Does not the fact that the obligation
here to pay in Philippine peso make it an obligation to pay in a
specified specie?

HELD: True, the obligation was to pay in Philippine pesos,
but this was not a stipulated specie, but obviously referred only
to the legal tender since after all, the most common occurrences
are transactions in Philippine pesos. It was never the intention
of the parties to specify that only Philippine pesos, of pre-war
valuation, may be paid. The use of the term “Philippine peso"
here is merely incidental.
380

Art. 1240

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHIUPPINES

Everett Steamship Corporation v.
Bank of the Philippine Islands
84 Phil. 202

FACTS: Plaintiff is a corporation in Manila, the majority
stockholders of which are American and British citizens.
Defendant is a banking corporation. Before December 1941,
plaintiff had a current account with the defendant, and on
December 29, 1941, the plaintiff had a valid balance in its

favor of P53,175.51, Philippine currency. During the Japanese
occupation, the officers of the plaintiff corporation were interned
by the Japanese Armed Forces inside the UST compound. By
order of the Japanese Military Administration, the defendant
was made to turn over the account of the plaintiff to the Bank of
Taiwan, the depository of Enemy Properties. The defendant thus
gave to the Bank of Taiwan a check in the sum of P53.175.51.
After liberation, plaintiff wanted to draw the P53.175.51 it
thought it still had, from the defendant bank. The latter pleaded
payment to the Bank of Taiwan.
ISSUE: May the plaintiff still recover from the defendant?

HELD: “In the instant case, the issue involved is whether
the Japanese Military Administration could validly require
the defendant-appellant to transfer to the Bank of Taiwan the
balance of plaintiffs current account with the defendant.”
“In the Hau> Pia case, the same issue was involved. The
Court ruled in the Haw Pia case that the collection by the Bank
of Taiwan of the China Banking Corporation’s credit from the
latter’s debtor, by order of the Japanese military administration,
was valid and released the defendant’s obligation to the
plaintiff.”

Republic v. Grijaldo
L-20240, Dec. 31, 1965

FACTS: In 1943, a borrower obtained loans from the

Bank of Taiwan. After the war, the Republic of the Philippines
sought to recover the loans. It was alleged by the debtor that
the Republic had no right to collect since the real creditor was
the Bank of Taiwan. It was further alleged that the loan was a
private contract between the borrower and the Bank, and that
therefore the Republic could not legally collect.
381

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1240

HELD; It is true that the Bank of Taiwan was the original
creditor, and that the transaction was a private contract.
However, pursuant to the Trading with the Enemy Act as
amended, and EO 9095 of the U.S., and under Vesting Order
P-4, dated Jan. 21, 1946, the properties of the Bank of Taiwan
were vested in the U.S. Government. Pursuant further to the
Philippine Property Act of 1946, and the Transfer Agreements
dated July 20, 1954 and June 15, 1957, the assets of the Bank
were transferred to and vested in the Republic of the Philippines.
Since the Republic is the successor to the rights in the loans,
it is evident that there has been created a privity of contract
between the Republic and the borrower, enabling the Republic
to sue for collection.

[NOTE: If the money is paid to the wrong party in good
faith, the debt is not extinguished. Moreover, the obligation
carries with it the payment of interest and the interest continues
to run. (See Keeler Electric Co. v. Rodriguez, 44 Phil. 29J]

Arcache v. Lizares & Co.
91 Phil. 348

FACTS: D owed C. Instead of paying C, D deposited the
money in a bank in the name and for the credit of C. All these
were done without Cs permission.
ISSUE: Has the debt been extinguished?
HELD: No. But if after efforts had been made, the creditor
could not be found, particularly at the place where payment is
supposed to be made, the debtor cannot be held guilty of default.

Phil. Nat. Bank v. Ereneta, et al.
L-13058, Aug. 28, 1959
Under the old law, RA 897, the acceptance of backpay
certificates in payment of loans to government corporations was
indeed an obligation upon the PNB. However, the enactment
of RA 1576, dated June 16, 1965, which added a new provision,
Section 9-a, to the Revised Charter of the PNB, removes this
obligation imposed upon said Bank.

Art. 1240

Josefina Ruiz de Luzuriaga Blanco v.
Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas, et al.
L-10810, Nov. 29, 1960

FACTS: Plaintiffs entrusted certain bonds to the Tabacalera
which they also made their depository, trustee, and attorney-infact. The bonds, issued by a Tarlac Sugar Central, fell due on or
before Nov. 15, 1943. Before said date, the Central notified the
Tabacalera of its intention to redeem said bonds. Tabacalera
then allowed the redemption. The money obtained was then
deposited in the Bank of Taiwan in the name of Tabacalera, as
depositary, trustee, and attomey-in-fact for plaintiffs. This was
done, however, by Tabacalera without notifying the plaintiffs
first. With the advent of liberation, deposits with the Bank of
Taiwan were rendered worthless.
ISSUE: Was Tabacalera’s act of consenting to the
redemption valid and binding on the plaintiffs?

HELD: Yes, because under the terms of the bonds, the
Sugar Central had the right to redeem the bonds on or before
the date specified, and Tabacalera had been properly made the
attomey-in-fact of the plaintiffs. No notice was needed under
the agreement between Tabacalera and the plaintiffs. Besides,
the redemption was properly made in Japanese currency
which was then valid legal tender. Tabacalera was, therefore,
right in surrendering the bonds that were being redeemed.
Plaintiffs must, therefore, bear the loss.

Rido Montecillo v. Ignacia Reynes & Sps. Redemptor
& Elisa Abucay
GR 138018, July 26, 2002

FACTS: Petitioner Montecillo’s Deed of Sale does not state
that the P47.000 purchase price should be paid by the former to
Cebu Ice Storage (CIS). Montecillo failed to adduce any evidence
before the trial court showing that Reynes had agreed, verbally
or in writing that the P47,000 purchase price should be paid to

CIS.
HELD: Absent any evidence showing that respondent
had agreed to the payment of the purchase price to any other
party, the payment to be effective must be made to respondent,

the payment that would extinguish the former’s obligation to
respondent under the Deed of Sale.

administer his property shall be valid if he has kept the thing
delivered, or insofar as the payment has been beneficial to

by virtue of A’s payment to B. True, B was incapacitated
to administer his own property, yet B has kept the thing

Payment made to a third person shall also be valid insofar
as it has redounded to the benefit of the creditor. Such benefit
to the creditor need not be proved in the following cases:
(1) If after the payment, the third person acquires the
creditor’s rights;
(2) If the creditor ratifies the payment to the third

person;
If by the creditor’s conduct, the debtor has been led
to believe that the third person had authority to receive the
payment.

1)

384

In question (b), suppose that a swindler had asked B for
Pl,000,000 in exchange for a ring worth P500.000, does
A’s payment to B remain valid?
ANS.: A’s payment to B remains valid only up to the
extent of P500,000, because this is only the amount which
B really benefited from A’s payment to him. A’s payment
is thus valid only insofar as the payment has benefited the
incapacitated payee.

(d)

Who has the burden of proving that the payment has
benefited the incapacitated payee?

ANS.: The one who made the payment has the burden
of proving that it benefited the incapacitated payee.
(Panganiban v. Cuevas, 7 Phil. 477) The benefit may be
financial, moral or intellectual but it must be proved. (Ibid.)

from the payment, is it necessary for the payor to prove
that the payee invested the thing or money delivered in
some profitable enterprise?

that is needed is proof that payment to the incapacitated
payee has in some way or another redounded to the benefit

Manresa 282)
A good example of beneficial payment to the incapacitated
person is when the money has been used for proper hospital
or psychiatric expenses.
If indeed there has been no benefit, what remedy is given?
ANS.: The payment is not valid; therefore, the legal
representative of the incapacitated person can demand
a new payment on behalf of his ward. The ward himself,
should he regain capacity, is allowed to claim a new
payment. (8 Manresa 279)

be the possessor only of the document, not the credit itself.

(4) Case

Sps. Alcaraz v. Tangga-an
GR 128568, April 9, 2003

FACTS: Petitioner-spouses aver that their payments to
Virgilio (who supposedly became the new owner of the house
after acquiring title to the lot) beginning Nov. 1993 were
payments made in good faith to a person in possession of the
credit, in consonance with Art. 1242. Payment made in good
faith to any person in possession of the credit shall release the
debtor. This, petitioner-spouses point out, released them from
their obligation. They claim that Virgilio collected the rentals in
387

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1242

his capacity as a co-owner, and being a son of Virginia (husband
of respondent Pedro Tangga-an), he (Virgilio) was also entitled
to the rent of the subject house.
HELD: This contention is incorrect. Virgilio collected the
rentals not as a co-owner but as the alleged sole owner of the
subject house. Petitioner-spouses themselves admitted that
Virgilio claimed sole ownership of the house and lot. It would
be incongruous for them to now assert payment in good faith to
a person they believed was collecting in behalf of his co-heirs
after admitting that they paid rent to Virgilio as the sole owner
thereof. Hence, for violating the terms of the lease contract, i.e.,
payment of rent, respondents can legally demand the ejectment
of petitioner-spouses.
(5) Belligerent Occupant

While a belligerent occupant such as the Japanese Armed
Forces during the World War II may sequester an enemy's
private credit (Haw Pia v. China Banking Corp., 80 Phil.
604 and Gibbs v. Rodriguez, 47 O.G. 186), mere attachment

of the property, without actual confiscation, does not confer
possession upon said belligerent. Such attachment or embargo
merely prohibits the owner from disposing thereof. This is no
segregation or sequestration of the properties; hence, payment
to such belligerent, who is not in possession of the credit, does
not extinguish the obligation, whether payment is made in good
faith or not. (Panganiban v. Cuevas, 7 Phil. 477)

Panganiban v. Cuevas
7 Phil. 477

FACTS: Panganiban sold a retro in 1897 his parcel of
land to Gonzales, but subsequently said land was attached by
the revolutionary government. Because he was not able to find
Gonzales on account of the war, Panganiban in good faith paid
the repurchase money to said revolutionary government. Later,
Gonzales sold the land to Cuevas. Panganiban then brought this
action to get the land from Cuevas.
HELD: The action will not prosper, because payment of
the repurchase money to the revolutionary government was not
valid. Said government merely attached the properties, merely

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1243

prohibited its alienation. Therefore, it was not in possession of
the credit. However, Panganiban can redeem the property from
Cuevas by giving him the repurchase money.

Art. 1243. Payment made to the creditor by the debtor
after the latter has been judicially ordered to retain the debt

shall not be valid.
COMMENT:
(1) Payment Made After Judicial Order to Retain

The judicial order may have been prompted by an order
of attachment, injunction or garnishment (garnishment takes
place when the debtor of a debtor is ordered not to pay the latter
so that preference would be given to the latter’s creditor). Note
that the payment in this Article is void.
(2) ‘Garnishment’ Defined

“The proceeding by which a debtor’s creditor is subjected to
the payment of his own debt to another is known as garnishment.
It consists in the citation of some stranger to the litigation, who
is the debtor of one of the parties to the action. By this means
such debtor-stranger becomes a forced intervenor, and the
court, having acquired jurisdiction over his person by means of
the citation required of him to pay his debt, not to his former
creditor, but to the new creditor, who is the creditor in the main
litigation.” (Tayabas Land Co. v. Charruf, 41 Phil. 382)
(3) Example of Garnishment

(a)

A owes B Pl,000,000. B, in turn, owes C P100.00O. C brings
an action against B, who, however, claims insolvency but
admits the credit which he has over A. Before A pays B,
A is summoned into the proceedings, and asked to retain
the debt in the meantime. Thus, the debt is “garnished.”
The reason is A should not pay B, and instead he should
pay C, should C really be adjudged the creditor of B. Any
payment made by A to B in the meantime is considered
invalid under the law.
389

388

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1243

Art 1244

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(b)

(c)

Suppose in the preceding example, A and B, in the
meantime, deposited the judicial order to the contrary
and supposing it should turn out that C is not really the
creditor of B as a consequence of which the garnishment
proceedings are dropped, should A again pay B, in view
of the fact that the first payment, strictly speaking, is not
valid under the law?
ANS.: It is submitted that A need not pay B a second
time. True, at the beginning the payment was not valid,
but the defect here has been cured by the dismissal of the
garnishment proceedings. It is as if there never had been
any judicial order asking the debtor A to retain the debt.
Furthermore, why should B, the creditor, be paid twice
for the same debt? To hold that he should be is to allow a
travesty of justice, an undue enrichment of B.
Pending garnishment, may the debtor be judicially ordered
to pay the creditor of his debtor (such creditor is the
garnishing or attaching creditor)?
ANS.: No, because under the Rules of Court, the credit
must be given to the clerk, sheriff, or other proper officer
of the court. (Sec. 8, Rule 57, Revised Rules of Court)

(4) ‘Interpleader* Defined

It is a technical name of the action in which a certain person
in possession of certain property wants claimants to litigate
among themselves for the same. The Revised Rules of Court
provides: “Whenever conflicting claims upon the same subject
matter are or may be made against a person who claims no
interest whatever in the subject matter, or an interest which in
whole or in part is not disputed by the claimants, he may bring
an action against the conflicting claimants to compel them to
interplead and litigate their several claims among themselves."
(Sec. 1, Rule 63)
(5) Example of Interpleader

A has in his possession some merchandise, to be delivered
to the person who presents the proper receipt. B and C, each
armed with a receipt, ask A to turn over the property to one
of them. An examination of the receipts reveals that they are
390

of exactly the same kind. A does not know to whom he should
deliver the property. So he files an action in court by means of
which B and C will be able to settle their conflicting rights. The
court must now issue an order prohibiting payment to either B
and C in the meantime. Despite the receipt of the order, A pays
B, who is the brother of his (A’s) sweetheart. Is said payment
valid? Obviously not. Reason: The payment here was made after
the debtor had been judicially ordered to retain the debt. Reason
for the law: Evidently, the debtor here (A) cannot say he paid B
in good faith. He had ulterior motives for his act, otherwise he
would not have disobeyed the lawful order of the court. Under
the law, therefore, A is deemed to be a payor in bad faith.
(6) ‘Injunction’ Defined

It is a judicial process by virtue of which a person is
generally ordered to refrain from doing something. It is called a
preliminary injunction if the prohibition is during the pendency
of certain proceedings.
(7) Example of Injunction

A owes B a sum of money. When A is about to pay B,
of the latter move to stop the payment on the
relatives
the
ground that B appears to be insane. However, proceedings in
court to determine B’s sanity are still in progress. Seeing A's
determination to pay, the relatives of B ask the court for a writ
of preliminary injunction restraining A from paying B in the
meantime. The injunction is granted. Would it be advisable for
A to pay B despite said injunction?
ANS.: No, it would not be advisable for A to pay while he is
under injunction; otherwise, his payment will not be valid since
this would then be payment made to the creditor by the debtor
after the latter has been judicially ordered to retain the debt.

Art 1244. The debtor of a thing cannot compel the creditor
to receive a different one, although the latter may be of the
same value as, or more valuable than that which is due.
In obligations to do or not to do, an act or forbearance
cannot be substituted by another act or forbearance against

in case there is another agreement resulting in either.
1) dation in payment (Art. 1245, Civil Code);

or novation (Art. 1291, Civil Code);
in case of waiver by the creditor (expressly or impliedly).

To pay my debt of Pl,000,000 in favor of Bella, I gave her
with her consent a diamond ring instead worth Pl,000,000.

(a)

(4) Reasons Why Dation in Payment Is Governed by the Law

of Sales

—

This is so because dation in payment the transfer or
conveyance of ownership of a thing as an accepted equivalent
really partakes in one sense of the nature
of performance
is really buying some property of the
creditor
i.e.,
sale,
the
of
debtor, payment for which is to be charged against the debtor’s
debt. However, it may also be called a “novation." But sales and
novation require common consent.

COMMENT:
(1) Obligation to Give Generic Things

Reasons for the Article:
the giving of the object
in lieu of the credit may
extinguish completely or
only partially the credit
(depending on the agree¬
ment). (8 Manresa 323)

(6) Conditions under Which a Dation in Payment Would Be

Valid

“This Article gives a principle of equity in that it applies
justice in a case where there is lack of precise declaration in
the obligation. It is always hard to find one thing that is exactly
similar to another. But in this kind of obligation, there is the
question of relative appreciation in that one party appreciates
the same thing as the other party does. If there is disagreement
between them, then the court steps in and declares whether
the contract has been complied with or not, according to the

circumstances.” (8 Manresa 280-281)
(2) Waiver

(a)

If the creditor consents, for a sale presupposes the consent
of both parties.

(b)

If the dation in payment will not prejudice the other
creditors, for this might lead the debtor to connive with
one creditor in defrauding the other creditors.

(c)

Art. 1247

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If the debtor is not judicially declared insolvent, for here his
property is supposed to be administered by the assignee.
[NOTE: In dation, it is not always necessary that all
the property of the debtor will be given to satisfy the credit.
(8 Manresa 232)]

[NOTE: For the distinction between cession
(assignment) and dation, refer to comments under Art.
1255.]

Art. 1246. When the obligation consists in the delivery
of an indeterminate or generic thing, whose quality and
circumstances have not been stated, the creditor cannot
demand a thing of superior quality. Neither can the debtor
deliver a thing of inferior quality. The purpose of the obliga¬
tion and other circumstances shall be taken into conside¬

ration.

394

(a)

—

If the contract does not specify the quality
the creditor cannot demand a thing of superior quality (but
if he desires, he may demand and accept one of inferior
quality).

(b)

the debtor cannot deliver a thing of inferior quality, but if he
so desires, he may deliver one of superior quality (provided
it is not of a different kind). (See Art. 1244, Civil Code)

(3) When Contract Is VOID

Note that the Article speaks of QUALITY and other
circumstances. When the KIND and QUANTITY (as distinguished
from quality) cannot be determined without need of a new
agreement of the parties, the contract is void. (Art. 1349 and
Art. 1409, No. 6, Civil Code)

“The object of every contract must be determinate as to its
kind.The fact that the quantity is not determined shall not be an
obstacle to the existence of the contract provided it is possible to
determine the same without the need of a new contract between
the parties.”

Art. 1247. Unless it is otherwise stipulated, the extrajudi¬
cial expenses required by the payment shall be for the account
of the debtor. With regard to judicial costs, the Rules of Court
shall govern.

Art. 124«

COMMENT:
(1) Debtor Pays Generally for Extrajudicial Expenses
General Rule:
The debtor has to pay for the extrajudicial expenses
incurred during the payment. Reason: By express provision of
law. Reason for the law: It is the debtor who benefits primarily,
since his obligation is thus extinguished.
Exception: When there is a stipulation to the contrary.
(2) What Governs Judicial Costs?

which the obligation consists has been completely delivered or
rendered, as the case may be. Hence, partial performance is not
allowed generally under Art. 1248.
(2) Exceptions

Partial performance is allowed:

When there is stipulation to this effect;
(b) When the different prestations are subject to different
conditions or different terms;

(a)

The Rules of Court, principally Rule 142.
(3) How Judicial Costs Are Determined

Generally, costs shall be awarded to the winning party. But
this is subject to the discretion of the court. “Unless otherwise
provided in these rules, costs shall be allowed to the prevailing
party as a matter of course, but the court shall have power, for
special reasons, to adjudge that either party shall pay the costs
of an action, or that the same be divided, as may be equitable."
(Sec. 1, Rule 142, Revised Rules of Court)
(4) Generally No Costs against the Government

“No costs shall be allowed against the Republic of the
Philippines, unless otherwise provided by law.” (Sec. 1, last
sentence, Rule 142, Revised Rules of Court)

Art. 1248. Unless there is an express stipulation to that
effect, the creditor cannot be compelled partially to receive
the prestations in which the obligation consists. Neither may
the debtor be required to make partial payments.

However, when the debt is in part liquidated and in
part unliquidated, the creditor may demand and the debtor
may effect the payment of the former without waiting for the
liquidation of the latter.

COMMENT:
(1) Performance Should Generally Be Complete
Under Art. 1233 of the Civil Code, a debt shall not be

understood to have been paid unless the thing or service in

Example: a debt payable in installments
When a debt is in part liquidated and in part unliquidated,
in which case performance of the liquidated part may be
insisted upon either by the debtor or the creditor,
Example: D owes C P3 million plus damages. Even if
the amount of damages has not yet been ascertained, the
P3 million is already known or liquidated. This is already
demandable and payable.

When a joint debtor pays his share or the creditor demands
the same;
[NOTE: This is a complete payment of his share, but
it is still a partial fulfillment of the whole obligation.]
(e) When a solidary debtor pays only the part demandable
because the rest are not yet demandable on account of their
being subject to different terms and conditions;
(f) In case of compensation, when one debt is larger than the
other, it follows that a balance is left (See Art. 1290, Civil

When work is to be done by parts. (See Art. 1720, Civil
Code)

[NOTE: In criminal law, the Supreme Court has held
that the acceptance of partial payment by an offended
party is not one of the means of extinguishing criminal
liability. The reason is: A criminal offense is committed
against the people, and the offended party may not waive

i

Art. 1249. The payment of debts in money shall be made
in the currency stipulated, and if it is not possible to deliver
such currency, then in the currency which is legal tender in
the Philippines.
The delivery of promissory notes payable to order, or bills
of exchange or other mercantile documents shall produce the
effect of payment only when they have been cashed, or when
through the fault of the creditor they have been impaired.

[NOTE: Registration and redemption of “guerilla
notes” are governed by RA’s 22 and 369, respectively.]
[NOTE: Under the old law, RA 897, the acceptance
of backpay certificates in payment of loans to government
corporations was indeed obligatory upon the Philippine
National Bank (PNB). However, the enactment of RA
1576, dated June 16, 1956, which adds a new provision.
Section 9-a, to the Revised Charter of the PNB, removes
this obligation imposed upon the said bank. (Phil. Nat.

In the meantime, the action derived from the original
obligation shall be held in abeyance.

It is that which a debtor may compel a creditor to accept
payment
of the debt (whether public or private).
in

Occupation
(a)

Payment of debts (pre-war and J apanese occupation debts)
made and due during the Japanese occupation was valid
because the Japanese notes were legal tender, so with all
transactions that did not partake of a political complexion,
unless there was some other defect. (Haw Pia v. China
Banking Corporation, 80 Phil. 604; Co Kim Cham v. Tan
Keh, GR L-5, S.C., Sept. 17, 1945; Orden de P.P. Benedictos
v. Phil. Trust Co., 47 O.G. No. 2894; and Filipinos Life
Assurance Co. v. Nava, L-20552, May 20, 1966)

(b)

But if the debt was not due and payable during the
Japanese occupation, payment thereof was VOID. ( Garcia
v. De los Santos, 49 O.G. 48; Nicolas v. Matias, L-1743)
Bank deposits during the occupation were not valid, but
withdrawals were valid and deductible, except insofar as
said withdrawal could be deducted from prior deposits of
Japanese money. (EO 49, the Lowest Minimun Balance or
Credit Law) The rule applies, whether the deposit was in
the form of cash or check. (Yek Tang Lin Fire and Marine
Insurance Co. v. PNB, L-14271, April 29, 1960) (Hilado v.
De la Costa, 83 Phil. 471, says the technical reason being
that a bank deposit is not a payment of any obligation,
whereas a bank withdrawal is a payment of the loan
contracted by the bank.) Moreover, one important reason

(2) Legal Tender in the Philippines

Before the advent of Martial Law, all notes and coins were
issued by the Central Bank (now Bangko Sentral)(without
a maximum limit). (Sec. 54, RA 265)
(b) Under Sec. 231 of PD 72 (Amending RA 265, the “Central
Bank Act’), of Martial Law, and effective Nov. 29, 1972, the
one centavo coin and the five centavo coin are valid legal
tender up to P20.00; the other coins (10, 25, 50, and Pl)
are valid legal tender up to P50.00; and all bills are valid
legal tender for any amount.
[NOTE: During the Japanese occupation, the following
were held to be legal tender:
(a) J apanese military notes. (Hau> Pia v. China Banking Corp.,
80 Phil. 604)
(b) “Emergency notes’ authorized and issued by the
Commonwealth Government, but these ceased to be legal
(a)

•

398

(c)

399

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1249

why in general the bank deposits were held void was that
banks are, ordinarily, obliged to receive deposits. There is
a sort of compulsion. Hence, EO 49 had to be issued in the
exercise of the police power of the state. (Feliciano Cruz v.
Aud. Gen., L-12233, May 30, 1959)
Example of General Rule:
Pl,000
300
100
350

P600

— (pre-war deposit)
— (1942 withdrawal)
— (1943 withdrawal)
— (1944 deposit)

— because the withdrawals must
be subtracted while the deposit will not be

(balance
added)

for the value paid during the Japanese occupation. The Aud.
Gen. refused on two grounds: Firstly, under EO 49, “deposits”
were considered void. Secondly, the loss of the “deposits" by a
fortuitous event must be borne by the depositor.

HELD: Cruz can recover for what he gave was not really
a deposit (a real contract), but an advance payment. Moreover,
EO 49, which speaks of “bank deposits” applies merely to banks,
who were then under a sort of compulsion to accept “deposits.”
Here, the Rural Prog. Adm. was under no compulsion. If at all,
it was Cruz who was compelled to pay the deposit required.
Cruz, however, should be credited only with the value in the
Ballantyne Scale, as the deposit could have been returned during
the war.

P950

— (pre-war deposit)
— (1942 deposit)
(1943 withdrawal)
— (1944
withdrawal)
—
(Reason: The P300 withdrawal can be

subtracted from the deposit of P350 because
said deposit was made use of, leaving P50
extra deposit. The second withdrawal of P100
can be charged to the remaining P50 and
to the original account of Pl,000 — leaving

P950.)

Feliciano A Cruz v. Auditor General
L-12233, May 30, 1959

FACTS: During the Japanese occupation, Cruz wanted to
purchase a lot made available to the public by the government
(Rural Prog. Adm.). The lot was the Sta. Clara Estate in
Sampaloc, Manila. Pursuant to government requisites, Cruz has
to pay Pl,160 in Japanese money as “deposit.’’ After liberation,
he sought the delivery to him of the lot. In the meantime, he
was required to pay the WHOLE purchase price. He now sues

If the debt was contracted during the occupation and
was payable ON DEMAND, but not yet paid when
liberation came, get the VALUE of the debt —
a) according to actual exchange rate at the time
it was due, between genuine currency and the
Japanese notes (Abendano v. Hao Su Ton, [CA]
47 O.G. 6359; and Barcelon v. Arambulo, [CA]
48 O.G. 3976);
b) or if such actual exchange rate could not be
proved, according to the Ballantyne Scale.
(Wilson v. Berkenkotter, 92 Phil. 918; Soriano
v. Abalos, 84 Phil. 206; and Gomez v. Tabia, 84
Phil. 269)
If the debt was contracted during the Japanese
occupation and was payable DURING the occupation
(same as No. 1). (Fernandez, etal.v. Nat. Ins. Co., GR
L-9416, Jan. 27, 1959)
(NOTE: If a check received as payment was
dated Jan. 5, 1945 (Japanese occupation period) but
was presented for payment only on Nov. 15, 1954
(post-liberation period), the check must be paid in
accordance with the Ballantyne schedule of values,
for after all, it was payable during the Japanese
occupation. (Garcia v. PNB, L-14996, May 31, 1961)]

If the debt was contracted during the Japanese
occupation and was payable EITHER DURING the
occupation or AFTER liberation (same as No. 1).
[Example:

D borrowed from C Pl,000 in 1942, and he
promised to pay it on or before Jan. 8, 1952. Here,
it is clear that the benefit of the term is given to D,
therefore he could have paid it during the occupation
or after liberation (1945). Therefore, the rules given
above can apply. (See Mercado v. Mercado, L-14461,
Aug. 29, 1960; see also Aguilar v. Miranda, L16510,
Nov. 29, 1961; and Server v. Car, L-22676, Nov. 23,
1966)]
4)

If the debt was contracted during the occupation
but was payable only AFTER liberation (Example:
"pay in 1974"), genuine Philippine currency MUST
BE PAID (not the equivalent actual exchange rate
NOR in accordance with the Ballantyne Scale).
(Wilson v. Berkenkotter, 92 Phil. 918; Ponce de Leon
v. Syjuco, Inc., 90 Phil. 311; Rono o. Gomez, 83 Phil.

Miranda, L-16510, Nov. 29, 1961; and Server v. Car,
L-22676, Nov. 23, 1966)
[NOTE: In the case of Sternberg and Sternberg
v. Soloman, L-10691, Jan. 31, 1958, it was held
that where the deed of mortgage dated Aug. 7, 1944
provided that the obligation secured thereby shall be
paid one year from the date thereof, or on Aug. 7, 1945,
“and expressly agreed not sooner,” it is understood
that the same was payable only after liberation and,
therefore, must be paid in Philippine currency on the
peso-to-peso basis.]
[NOTE: In the case of Kare and Bausa v.
Imperial, et al., L-7906 and L-10176, Oct. 22, 1957,
the Court said that one of the reasons for that
402

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1249

ruling is that the parties in stipulating to have the
monetary obligation discharged not before but after
the termination of the war, intended to have the said
obligation paid, not in Japanese war notes nor their
value, but in Philippine currency.
Incidentally too, in said case, where the parties
agreed that payment would be made not sooner than
six months nor later than eighteen months after the
“termination of the Greater East Asia war,” the court
held that the termination of such war is to be based
on its legal meaning or legal sense, namely, the official
proclamation which was made on Dec. 31, 1946)}
[NOTE: Where under the contract, the vendors
were allowed to exercise their right to repurchase within
the period of ten years from the day of execution (Feb.
22, 1944) on condition that they may exercise their right
only after the expiration of the first five years, this right
became vested only after the liberation of the Philippines.
Hence, payment can only be effected in accordance with
the present currency. (Ceyras, et al. v. Ulanday, L-12700,
June 29, 1959)]

[This scale was taken from the Bill sent by President
Osmena to Congress on December 13, 1945. Mr. Ballantyne
was a Special Bank Adviser to the President. Unfortunately, the
Bill, although approved by Congress of the Philippines, was not
approved by the President of the United States to which it had
been sent for approval. Nevertheless, the Ballantyne Scale has
been applied in several instances both by the Philippine Supreme
Court, and by the Philippine Court of Appeals. The Scale is now
a matter that comes within judicial notice, inasmuch as it has
now become part of our jurisprudence. So, even if not set up
as a defense or proved, it may be considered. (Lopez v. Ochoa,
D7955, May 30, 1958)]
(4) Illustrative Cases

Allison J. Gibbs, etc. v. Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr^ etc.
L-1494, Aug. 3, 1949
(Validity of Japanese Transactions)
FACTS: A mortgaged two parcels of land to B, an American
company in the Philippines. A assigned, with the consent of B,
his (A’s) rights to C. During the Japanese occupation, C paid off
the mortgage to the Department of Enemy Property established
by the Japanese Military Administration. The Register of Deeds
then cancelled the mortgage. Now B brings this action against
C for the amount of the mortgage, and against the Register of
Deeds for the restoration of the mortgage.
ISSUE: Was the payment by C to the Bureau of Enemy
Property valid?
HELD: The question involved in the instant case is whether
or not the payment of the mortgage deed to the Bureau of Enemy
Property is valid. In the Haw Pia Case, the court held that such
collection of credit was not a confiscation but a sequestration
of the enemy private properties and, therefore, the payment by
Haw Pia to the Bank of Taiwan was valid and released plaintiffs
obligation to the defendant Bank. In the present case, the issue
is similar. Therefore, the decision should be the same, that is,
C has already paid off the mortgage, and the Register of Deeds
acted legally when he cancelled the mortgage. Hence, B cannot
recover anything from C.

Domingo Aurreocoecha v. Kabankalan Sugar Co., Inc.
81 Phil. 476
(Defense of Alleged Duress)

FACTS: Plaintiff had a deposit account with the defendant
corporation. On October 12, 1941, plaintiff notified the defendant
of his (the plaintiffs) intention to withdraw all his deposits.
Because of the outbreak of the war, it was only on April 18,
1943 that the defendant acted on the plaintiffs application for
withdrawal. On said date, the plaintiff received his balance,
amounting to P55.957.75. The following day, the plaintiff
deposited said amount with the Philippine National Bank. By
liberation time, plaintiff did not have anymore money. Plaintiff
brought this action to recover from the defendant corporation
the amount of P55.957.75 on the ground that he accepted the
money under duress because he was afraid that if he refused,
he would be taken to Fort Santiago.
ISSUE: Was the payment to plaintiff in Japanese war notes
valid such that the defendant corporation has extinguished its
obligation?

HELD: Yes. Payment of pre-war debts in Japanese money
during the occupation is, as a general rule, valid. The supposed
threat or duress here was certainly not one to inspire genuine
fear in a man of the plaintiffs position. And even if the payment
in Japanese money did not extinguish the obligation still his
subsequent act of making use of the money ratified the payment.
Granting that he was threatened into accepting the money, he
was not in any way compelled to spend said money.
Philippine Trust Co. v. Luis Ma. Araneta, et al.
83 Phil. 132
(No Collective or General Duress)

FACTS: Before the war, Araneta owed the Philippine
Trust Co. the sum of P3,683.60, secured by some certificate
of stock. On May 2, 1944, the Company made a demand on
Araneta. Araneta paid, but the certificates of stocks pledged
could not be given because according to the Company, they had
been turned over to the U.S. for safekeeping during the war.
After liberation, Araneta asked the company for the return of
405

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1249

the certificates of stocks, but the company refused to do so on
the ground that payment in Japanese war notes was not valid
because of collective or general duress.
HELD: In the Haw Pia case, note that under the rules of
Public International Law, the right of the military occupant in
the exercise of his governmental power to order the liquidation
of enemy banks and the reopening of others in the occupied
territory, as well as to issue military currency as legal tender,
has been conceded.

It is evident that the payment made by the respondent
(Araneta) and accepted by the petitioner (Philippine Trust Co.)
during the Japanese occupation in compliance with the said
orders of the Japanese military occupant, cannot be considered
as made under a collective and general duress, because an act
done pursuant to the laws or orders of competent authorities
can never be regarded as executed involuntarily or under
duress of illegitimate constraint of compulsion that invalidates
the act.
De Asis v. Buenviaje, et cd.
45 O.G. No. 1, p. 317
(Seller Benefited with Use of Japanese Money)

FACTS: A sold B some properties during the Japanese
occupation. A received war notes as payment. After liberation,
A sought to recover the properties on ground that the money
paid to him was worthless.
ISSUE: Is A correct?
HELD: A is not correct. Because A willingly sold said
properties and benefited with the use of the purchase money, he

cannot now, on the ground, attack the validity of the sale. “The
Japanese war notes were legal tender during the occupation and
in March 1943, when the sale in question was made, they were
at par with Philippine currency. Those who sold their properties
then and voluntarily accepted said notes in payment therefor
have to suffer the consequences when the notes depreciated in
value or became worthless.”

Mondejar v. Nicolo
43 O.G. No. 12, p. 5099
(When “Emergency Notes” Ceased
to Be Legal Tender)

FACTS: A was a sub-lessor, and B, a sub-lessee. In payment
of rentals, B was paying A “emergency notes” but since A did
not want to accept, B deposited the money with the Municipal
Treasurer’s Office on April 7, 1945. It was proved, however, that
on said date, the “emergency notes” were no longer legal tender.
ISSUE: Was the deposit in the office equivalent to payment?
HELD: No, said deposit was not equivalent to payment
because at that time, the “emergency notes” were no longer
legal tender. They were good only up to Nov. 18, 1944 by virtue
of EO 25.
Fernandez, et al. v.
Nat. Insurance Co. of the Philippines
L-9146, Jan. 27, 1957

FACTS: Juan Fernandez’ life was insured on July 15,
1944. He died on Nov. 2, 1944. In 1952, the beneficiaries claim
the indemnity On July 9, 1954, proof of death was approved by
the company. Under the Insurance Law, a life insurance policy,
in the absence of a definite period, matures upon DEATH, and
payment of indemnity must be made within 60 days from proof
of death.
ISSUE: When did the obligation of the insurance company
to pay the indemnity accrue: in 1944 (death) or in 1954 (approval
of proof of death)? If in 1944, the Ballantyne scale can be used,
for it can be said that the obligation arose during the Japanese
occupation; if in 1954, the Ballantyne scale cannot obviously be
used.

HELD: The obligation accrued in 1944 when the insured
died, hence the Ballantyne scale can be used. The 60-day period
fixed in the Insurance Law is merely procedural in nature; it is
the death that matures the policy.

Art. 1249

(5) Stipulation of Another Currency
(a)

Under the first paragraph of Art. 1249, payment may be
either:
1)

in the currency stipulated;

2)

or if it is not possible to deliver such currency, then
in Philippine legal tender.

•»

(b)

Said first paragraph of Art. 1249 has already been modified
by RA 529.

Under the said Act, obligations incurred AFTER
RA 529 (June 16, 1950), which are for the purpose of
payment in:

(c)

1)

a foreign currency

2)

an amount of Philippine money to be measured by
gold or foreign currency, should be null, void and of
no effect.

RA 529, in connection with Art. 1249 of the Civil Code,
has been discussed by the Supreme Court in the following
cases, among others:
1)

Eastboard Navigation Co. v. Ysmael and Co., L-9090,
Sept. 10, 1957.

2)

Arrieta v. National Rice and Com Corp., L-15645,
Jan. 31, 1964.
Thus, the Court has ruled that if the debtor
promises to pay in a currency other than Philippine
legal tender, the stipulation with respect to the
currency is VOID. All that the creditor can demand is
payment in Philippine legal tender measured at the
exchange rate prevailing not at the time of payment,
but at the time of contracting or incurring the debt.
(See Arrieta v. National Rice and Com Corp., L-15645,

(d)

Jan. 31, 1964)
However, RA 529 has in turn been amended by RA 4100,
which took effect on June 19, 1964.

408

Art. 1249

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Phoenix Assurance Company v.
Macondray and Co., Inc.
L-25048, May 13, 1975

ISSUE: If a court judgment states that an amount
in dollars is supposed to be paid the winning party, what
table of conversion (of exchange rates) must be used that
at the time the contract was entered into, that at the time
of judgment, or that at the time payment or satisfaction of
the judgment is made?

—

HELD: The conversion rate at the time of payment
or satisfaction of the judgment. If said time of payment or
satisfaction is disputed, the trial court will determine when
said payment or satisfaction was made.
[NOTE: Under RA 4100 which took effect on June
19, 1964 and which amended RA 529 which in turn had
modified Art. 1249 of the Civil Code in “import-export
and other international banking, financial investment
and industrial transactions” the parties' agreement as to
currency in which an obligation will be paid is BINDING.]
(This was a NOTE in the Phoenix case.)
[NOTE: Before the effectivity of RA 4100, the
applicable rule was RA 529 which generally prohibited
transactions in foreign currency, including dollars. This
is why in Arrieta u. National Rice and Corn Corporation,
L-15645, Jan. 31, 1964, 62 O.G. 9810, 10 SCRA 79, 88,
an award of damages amounting to $286,000 was made
payable in Philippine pesos, according to the prevailing
rate of exchange on July 1, 1952, when the contract
was executed (not when the contract was satisfied). The
payment in dollars being void, payment must be made in
pesos, understood to be at the conversion rate when the
contract was entered into, not when the amount is paid or

——

satisfied.]

Zagala v. Jimenez
GR 33050, July 23, 1987
A judgment awarding an amount in U.S. dollars may
be paid with its equivalent amount in local currency in the
conversion rate prevailing at the time of payment. If the
409

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1249

parties cannot agree on the same, the trial court should
determine such conversion rate. Needless to say, the
judgment debtor may simply satisfy said award by paying
in full the amount in U.S. dollars.

If the plaintiff files a motion to fix the peso value of
the judgment in dollars, they only intend to exercise the
right granted to them by the present jurisprudence that
the trial court shall determine or fix the conversion rate
prevailing at the time of payment, and it is error for the
trial court to deny said motion.

—

(6) Uniform Currency Law

C.F. Sharp & Co. v. Northwest Airlines
GR 133498, April 18, 2002
The repeal of RA 529 by RA 8183 has the effect of removing
the prohibition on the stipulation of currency other than
Philippine currency, such that obligations or transactions may
now be paid in the currency agreed upon by the parties.
Just like RA 529, however, the new law does not provide
for the applicable rate of exchange for the conversion of foreign
currency-incurred equivalent. It follows, therefore, that the
jurisprudence established in RA 529 regarding the rate of
conversion remains applicable.

Obligations in foreign currency may be discharged in
Philippine currency based on the prevailing rate at the time of
payment. The wisdom on which the jurisprudence interpreting
RA 529 is based equally holds true with RA 8183. Verily, it is
just and fair to preserve the real value of the foreign exchangeincurred obligation to the date of its payment.

Problem:
In 1990, Deutsche Bank Phils. (DBP) extended loans
to XYZ Co. consisting of $10 million for the cost of machines
imported and directly paid by DBP, and P5 million in cash
payable in installments over a period of 10 years on the basis
of the value thereof completed at the rate of exchange of the
U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the Philippine peso at the time of payment.
XYZ Co. made payments on both Ioans which if based on the
410

Art. 1249

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

rate of exchange in 1990 would have fully-settled the loans by
to date (2012). DBP, upon the other hand, contends that the
payments on both loans should be based on the rate of exchange
existing at the time of payment, which rate of exchange has
been consistently increasing and for which reason there would
still be a considerable balance on each loan. Is the contention
of DBP correct? Discuss fully.
Answer:
As regards the loan consisting of dollars, the contention
of DBP is correct. It has to be paid in Philippine currency
though, computed on the basis of the exchange rate at the time
of payment of each installment, as ruled in Kalalo v. Luz, 34
SCRA 337. Now as regards the P5 million loan is Philippine
pesos, DBP is wrong. Payment thereof commit be measured
by the peso-dollar exchange rate. That will be violative of the
Uniform Currency Act (RA 529) which prohibits the payment of
an obligation which, although to be paid in Philippine Currency,
as held in Palanca v. Court of Appeals, 238 SCRA 593, is
measured by a foreign currency.
(7) BAR

In a ten-year lease of a store space on the Escolta to be
dated today, may the parties stipulate that the rental shall be for
every month, the equivalent rent in pesos, during the preceding
month, of $500? Briefly explain your answer.
ANS.: The parties to the lease are not allowed to stipulate
that the rental, although payable in pesos, shall be the equivalent
of $500 because under RA 529, such a provision is considered
null and void, if the same was agreed upon after said Act, which
amended Art. 1249 of the new Civil Code, became effective.
Section 1 of said Act states: “Every provision contained in . . .
any obligation which provision purports to give the obligee the
right to require payment in gold or in a particular kind of coin
or currency other than the Philippine currency, or in an amount
of money of the Philippines measured thereby, shall be as it is
hereby declared against public policy, null and void and of no
effect, and no such provision shall be contained in, or made with
respect to, any obligation hereinafter incurred.
411

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1249

[NOTE: Rules for obligations incurred PRIOR to RA 529
and payable in a FOREIGN CURRENCY
(a) If it was an obligation (which was NOT a loan), payment
should be made in Philippine currency at the rate of
exchange prevailing at the time the obligation was
INCURRED.
(b) If it was a LOAN, payment should also be in Philippine
currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of
the stipulated date of payment. (RA 529) Hence, a letter
of credit for $14,000 obtained on or before 1949 must be
paid in Philippine currency at the rate of P2 for $1 instead
of P2.41 for every dollar, since RA 529 cannot impair
obligations incurred prior to its effectivity in 1951. (PNB v.
Zulueta, L-7271, Aug. 30, 1957 reiterated in PNB v. Union
Books, L-8490, Aug. 30, 1957) (In said cases, the court held
that whether payable in dollars or in the equivalent of
dollars in Philippine currency, the same principle would
apply.)]

2)

(a)

A check is not legal tender and, therefore, the creditor
cannot be compelled to accept payment through this means.
(Belisario v. Natividad, 60 Phil. 156 and Villanueva v.
Santos, 67 Phil. 648) The rule applies even when payment
is made through consignation in court. (Villanueva v.
Santos, 67 Phil. 648)

(b)

Even a bank manager's check is not legal tender. (Cuaycong
v. Rius, 47 O.G. No. 6125)

(c)

Instances when a check or a commercial document should
be accepted as payment:
1)

when the creditor is in estoppel or he had previously
promised he would accept a check;

412

when the check has lost its value because of the fault
of the creditor (Art. 1249, 2nd par.), as when he has
unreasonably delayed in presenting the check for
payment (Phil. Nat. Bank v. Seeto, L-4388, Aug.
13, 1952), or when, in the case of a foreign bill of
exchange, the creditor neglects to make a protest
(Quiros v. Tan Guinlay, 5 Phil. 675);

3)

(d)

when payment occurs not because of a debt but
because of the exercise of the right of conventional
redemption, since this right is a right, and not a
duty, particularly when the check is in fact deposited
by the clerk of court with the bank, and the vendee
a retro has petitioned the court that he be allowed
to withdraw the amount of the deposit. (Cordero v.
Siosoco, 41 O.G. No. 4644)

Problem

In payment of his debt, D paid C a promissory note
payable to Cs order. C accepted the promissory note. Does
this mean that the payment has been effected?
ANS.: Not yet. The effect of payment in this case will
be produced only when the note has been cashed; and also,
even if it cannot be cashed because of the creditor’s fault.
(Art. 1249, par. 2, Civil Code)

[NOTE: It has also been held that a debtor cannot
be required to pay the foreign exchange tax, imposed by
law after the obligation was constituted, for remitting
the payment to the creditor abroad in dollars. (Eastboard
Navigation v. Ysmael, L-9090, Sept. 10, 1957)]

(e)

Problem

D in payment of a debt, paid C, with Cs consent, a
promissory note payable two months later. During the
intervening period, may C bring an action to recover from
D?
ANS.: No, for under the law, pending the cashing
of the mercantile document, “the action derived from the
original obligation shall be held in abeyance.” (Art. 1249,
last sentence, Civil Code)
Quiros v. Tan Guinlay
5 Phil. 675
FACTS: A was in possession of a bill of exchange endorsed
to him or his order. In payment of merchandise, A indorsed the
413

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1250

'

bill of exchange tn B who willingly accepted it. When B presented
the bill of exchange to the bank, the bank refused to pay, on the
ground that the supposed acceptance (written on the bill) by the
bank was a forgery. B did not make a protest and in the course
of time, the bill lost completely its value. Later B sued A for the
price of the merchandise.

ISSUE: Can B recover?
HELD: No, B cannot recover from A. By reason of the
neglect ofB, the creditor, the value of the bill has been impaired.
B cannot blame A, and, therefore, the delivery of the bill by A
to B operated as complete payment for the merchandise.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1250

COMMENT:
(1) ‘Inflation’ Defined

It is a sharp sudden increase of money or credit or both
without a corresponding increase in business transaction.
(Webster’s Dictionary) Since the value of money here tends to
decrease, the natural result is an increase in the price of goods
and services.
(2) “Deflation’ Defined

It is the opposite of inflation.
(3) Non-applicability of the Article Today

(9) Postdated Checks

Ongsip v. Prudential Bank
GR 27328, May 30, 1983
A postdated check is not a check at all, and a bank is
not allowed to deduct from a depositor’s current account the
postdated check issued by the depositor.
(10) Financial Difficulty

Jaso v. Lourdes
827 SCRA 569

The Article speaks of the inflation or deflation of “the
currency stipulated,” meaning, the currency OTHER THAN
Philippine legal tender as allowed under Art. 1249. But since
today, no foreign currency can be stipulated under RA 529, it
follows that literally construed, Art. 1250 cannot be made use
of for the present. By analogy or extension, however, it may be
possible to include the extraordinary inflation or deflation of
the Philippine currency. Today, however, it is doubtful whether
what we are experiencing today may already be classed in the

category of “extraordinary.”
Evelyn J. Sangrador, Joined by her husband
Rodrigo Sangrador, Jr.
v. Spouses Francisco Valderrama
and Teresita M. Valderrama
GR 79552, Nov. 29, 1988

(2017)

ISSUE: Can Lourdes’ alleged financial difficulty due to
the sickness and untimely death of her father and sister-in-law
justify her non-payment of the loan for a long period of time?
HELD: Financial difficulty is not an excuse to renege on
one’s obligation.

Art. 1250. In case an extraordinary inflation or deflation
of the currency stipulated should supervene, the value of the
currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation
shall be the basis of payment, unless there is an agreement
to the contrary.

414

Since petitioners failed to prove the supervening of
extraordinary inflation between April 6, 1984 and Dec. 7, 1984
no proofs were presented on how much, for instance, the price
index of goods and services had risen, during the intervening
period
an extraordinary inflation cannot be assumed;
consequently, there is no reason or basis, legal or factual, for
adjusting the value of the Philippine peso in the settlement of
respondents' obligation.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1250

Filipino Pipe and Foundry Corp. v.

National Waterworks and
Sewerage Authority

GR 43446, May 3, 1988
Extraordinary inflation exists when “there is a decrease
or increase in the purchasing power of the Philippine currency
which is unusual or beyond the common fluctuation in the
value of said currency, and such decrease or increase could not
have been reasonably foreseen or was manifestly beyond the
contemplation of the parties at the time of the establishment of
the obligation.”
An example of extraordinary inflation is the following
description of what happened to the deutschemark in 1920:
“More recently, in the 1920’s Germany experienced a case of
hyperinflation. In early 1921, the value of the German mark was
4.2 to the U.S. dollar. By May of the same year it had stumbled
to 62 to the U.S. dollar. And as the prices went up rapidly, so
that by Oct. 1923, it had reached 4.2 trillion to the U.S. dollar!”
As reported, “prices were going up every week, then every day,
then every hour. Women were paid several times a day so that
they could rush out and exchange their money for something of
value before what little purchasing power was let dissolved in
their hands. Some workers tried to beat the constantly rising
prices by throwing their money out of the windows to their
waiting wives, who would rush to unload the nearly worthless
paper. A postage stamp cost millions of marks and a loaf of bread
billions.”
While there has been a decline in the purchasing power of
the Philippine peso, this downward fall of the currency cannot
be considered “extraordinary.” It is simply a universal trend
that has not spared our country.
(4) Basis for Payment

Under this Article, the basis for payment is the value (the
real value or worth) at the time the obligation was constituted
or incurred, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.

416

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1250

Pan American v. PAA Employees
L-18345, Jan. 30, 1964
The purchasing power or value of money or currency does
not lawfully depend upon, cannot lawfully come into being, be
created, or brought about by, a law enacted by Congress. If
by law or treaty the rate of exchange between two currencies
should be fixed or stipulated, such law or treaty could not give
the money or currency the purchasing power or value fixed or
Stipulated, but would bind the Government enacting the law or
the contracting parties to a treaty to pay or supply the difference
between the value fixed or stipulated and the real value of the
currency should the latter be lower than the fixed or stipulated
rate of exchange between the two currencies.

Commissioner of Public Highways v.
Hon. Burgos, et al.
L-36706, March 31, 1980

Article 1250 applies only to cases where a contract or
agreement is involved. It does not apply where the obligation
to pay arises from law, independent of contracts. The taking
of private property by the Government in the exercise of its
power of eminent domain does not give rise to a contractual
obligation. Under the law, in the absence of any agreement to the
contrary, even assuming that there has been an extraordinary
inflation within the meaning of Art. 1250, the value of the peso
at the time of the establishment of the obligation, which in the
instant case is when the property was taken possession of by the
Government, must be considered for the purpose of determining
just compensation.
Obviously, there can be no agreement to the contrary to
speak of because the obligation of the Government sought to be
enforced in the present action does not originate from a contract,
but from law which, generally, is not subject to the will of the
parties. And there being no other legal provision cited which
would justify a departure from the rule that just compensation is
determined on the basis of the value of the property at the time of
the taking thereof in expropriation by the Government, the value
of the property as it is when the Government took possession of
the land in question, not the increased value resulting from the
417

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1251

passage of time which invariably brings unearned increment to
landed properties, represents the true value to be paid as just
compensation for the property taken.
Moreover, the law clearly provides that the value of the
currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation
shall be the basis of payment which, in cases of expropriation,
would be the value of the peso at the time of the taking of the
property when the obligation of the Government to pay arises.
It is only when there is an agreement to the contrary that the
extraordinary inflation will make the value of the currency at
the time of payment, not at the time of the establishment of the
obligation, the basis for payment.
In other words, an agreement is needed for the effects of
an extraordinary inflation to be taken into account to alter the
value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the
obligation which, as a rule, is always the determinative element,
to be varied by agreement that would find reason only in the
supervision of extraordinary inflation or deflation.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If the debtor changes his domicile in bad faith or after he
has incurred in delay, the additional expenses shall be borne
by him.

These provisions are without prejudice to venue under
the Rules of Court.

COMMENT:
(1) Where Payment Must Be Made

If there is a stipulation

(b)

If there is no stipulation
1)

in the place DESIGNATED

If it is an obligation to deliver a determinate specific
thing, then in the place where the thing might be
(usually or habitually) at the time the obligation
was CONSTITUTED. (If merely temporarily there,
as when the object is being shipped or is already in
the ocean, payment should be at the domicile of the
debtor.)

The applicability or non-applicability of Art. 1250 should be
taken as obiter dicta, since said article may not be invoked nor
applied, without a proper declaration of extraordinary inflation
or deflation of currency by the competent authorities. The Court
has, thus, set aside respondent judge’s raising of the amount of
compensation for the land from P14.615.79 (at P2.37 per square
meter) as properly determined to be its value at the time of its
taking in 1924 to P49,459.34 purportedly because of the deflated
value of the peso in relation to the dollar.

418

—

(a)

Acting Chief Justice Claudio Teehankee (concurring):

Art. 1251. Payment shall be made in the place designated
in the obligation.
There being no express stipulation and if the undertaking
is to deliver a determinate thing, the payment shall be made
wherever the thing might be at the moment the obligation
was constituted.
In any other case the place of payment shall be the
domicile of the debtor.

Art. 1251

2)

,

If the obligation is any other thing (as when it is to
deliver a generic thing, or to give money, or a personal
obligation), delivery must be made at the domicile of
the debtor.

(2) Examples

Ordinarily, a tenant of a house has the right to wait for the
landlord in the house since this is an obligation to pay money
(a generic thing). (Manalac v. Garcia, 76 Phil. 216; Gomez v.
Ng Fat, 76 Phil. 555) Similarly, a judgment debtor has to pay
only at his domicile, in the absence of a specification in the
court decree. (Eastboard Navigation v. Ysmael, L-9090, Sept.
10, 1957) Payment not at the designated place but only to the
mere depository of the creditor’s funds is not considered as valid.
So if Iloilo was designated, but tender is made in Manila, the
payment is not generally to be made at the latter place. (Gonzaga
& Hernandez v. Rehabilitation Finance Corp., L-8947, Feb. 10,
;

1957)

.

Manalac v. Garcia
76 Phil. 216
FACTS: A rented a house from B. Although there was
no need to do so, it was expressly agreed that payment of the
rental should be made at the domicile of the lessee A. When the
time for payment came, A waited at the house for a receipt to be
presented to him. But B delayed several months, on the ground
that A should have gone to B (and not B to a A).

ISSUE: Is A in default?
HELD: No, A is not in default. He was justified in waiting
for the receipt at the house he was renting. Said the Supreme
Court: “The payment of the rental having been agreed to be
made at the domicile of the debtor, he had a right to wait that
the receipt be presented to him and he does not incur default
for the time the creditor allows to pass without realizing the
collection.” (Translation)
Gomez v. Ng Fat
75 Phil. 555
FACTS: A tenant was being ousted by his landlord on the
ground of non-payment of rentals. The tenant’s defense was that
the collector, who usually collected the rentals, did not appear
and although he was willing to pay, still he was waiting for said
collector.
ISSUE: Was the tenant justified?
HELD: Yes, the tenant was justified. “It may also be
remarked that the appellant’s (tenant’s) alleged default cannot
give way to their ejectment, since it is attributable in part to
plaintiff’s (owner’s) omission or neglect to collect.”

Eastboard Navigation, Ltd. v. Ysmael and Co.
L-9090, Sept 10, 1957

If the court’s judgment confirming the award of a board
of arbitrators does not specify the place where the obligation
should be paid, the judgment debtor may pay it in his domicile
(Manila). He cannot be required to pay his creditor in New York
just because the latter happens to be there.

Gonzaga and Hernandez v.
Rehabilitation Finance Corp.
L-8947, Feb. 20, 1957
FACTS: A married couple obtained a loan from the
Agricultural and Credit Bank of P37.000 with their land given by
way of mortgage. The loan was contracted prior to the war. It was
agreed that payment was to be made in Manila. During the war,
the debtors paid not in Manila but in Iloilo, and the recipient
of the money was not the Iloilo branch of the Agricultural and
Credit Bank (for it was then closed) but the Iloilo branch of the
Philippine National Bank, which was the depository in Iloilo of
the funds belonging to the Agricultural and Credit Bank. After
liberation, the married couple went to Manila, and asked for the
cancellation of the mortgage on the ground that the indebtedness
of P37.000 had already been paid. The creditor refused. Instead
of going to court, the married couple again borrowed from the
creditor the “additional amount of PIO,000” and as security,
they offered a “second mortgage" on the same land that had been
given as security before. Three years later, the married couple
filed in court an action to cancel the mortgage on the P37.000
prewar loan on the ground of payment.
ISSUE: Was the payment valid?
HELD: The payment was VOID because:
1) Payment was not made to the creditor or to his duly
authorized agent. (If the Iloilo PNB branch acted as agent,
it was an agent for the debtors, not for the creditor, for
whom it was merely a depository of funds.)
2) Payment was made in Iloilo, not in Manila, which was the
designated place.
3) The debtors are in estoppel (for instead of bringing a court
action right away, after the creditor’s first refusal, they
instead borrowed again “an additional sum of PIO,000,” and
executed a “second mortgage on the same land,” implying
that they were willing to admit the continued existence of
the first indebtedness of P37.000.
The payment being void, it follows that the mortgage
remains valid and should not be cancelled.

Subsection 1
APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS
Art. 1252. He who has various debts of the same kind
in favor of one and the same creditor, may declare at the
time of making the payment, to which of them the same
must be applied. Unless the parties so stipulate, or when the
application of payment is made by the party for whose benefit
the term has been constituted, application shall not be made

as to debts which are not yet due.

If the debtor accepts from the creditor a receipt in which
an application of the payment is made, the former cannot
complain of the same, unless there is a cause for invalidating
the contract.

“It is the designation of the debt to which should be applied
a payment made by a debtor who owes several debts in favor of
the same creditor.” (Castan) Stated differently, it is the phrase
applied to show which debt, out of two or more debts owing the
same creditor, is being paid.
(3) Importance

It is important to know the rules on application of payments
because otherwise, we may not know which one, of two or more
debts, has been extinguished.
422

(6) Preferential Right of Debtor

It is the debtor who is given by the law the right to select
which of his debts he is paying. This right is not absolute,
however. For example:
(a) If there was a valid prior but contrary agreement, the
debtor cannot choose;
(b) The debtor cannot choose to pay part of the principal ahead
of the interest (Art. 1253, Civil Code and Sunico v. Ramirez,
14 Phil. 500), unless the creditor consents.
If the debtor makes a proper application and the
creditor refuses, the creditor will be in mora accipiendi.
423

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1262

(7) How Application of Payment Is Made

(9) Revocation of the Application

(a)

The debtor makes the designation. (Art. 1252, par. 1, Civil
Code);

(b)

If not, the creditor makes it, by so stating in the receipt
that he issues, “unless there is cause for invalidating the
contract” (Art. 1251, par. 2, Civil Code);
[NOTE: Thus, if the obligation itself is void, the
application and the payment are also void. (Sanchez
Roman) If the debtor’s consent in accepting the receipt was
vitiated as by fraud, error, or violence the application
is not valid, i.e., it is voidable.]

—

(c)

Art. 1262

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

—

If neither the debtor nor the creditor has made the
application, or if the application is not valid, then
application is made by operation of law. (Arts. 1253 and
1254, Civil Code)

(8) Application Made by Creditor

If the creditor makes the application without the knowledge
and consent of the debtor, the application is not valid. (Bank of
the Phil. Islands v. Espinosa, [CA] 40 O.G. Sup. 4, p. 68, Aug.
23, 1941)

Bank of the Phil. Islands v. Espinosa
(CjL) 40 O.G. Sup. 4, p. 68, Aug. 23, 1941

FACTS: A and B borrowed P5,000 from a bank. The liability
of A and B in this contract was solidary. A gave B a check worth
P2,000; B presented the check to the bank and B got the money.
Later C, a debtor of A, paid the account of P5,000 to the bank.
The bank said that its total credit was P7,000 (P5,000 from A
and B, P2.0OO from A), and that since only P5,000 has been paid,
A and B still owe P2,000 solidarity. B pleaded as his defense,
payment of the original P5.000 and that therefore he should be
released from all liability. Decide the case.

HELD: B’s obligation has already been extinguished. The
bank had no right to include the P2,000 to the solidary debt of
P5,000. Such application was not made with the knowledge and
consent of the debtor B. Only A is liable therefor.

Once an application of payments is made, may it be revoked1?
ANS.: No (Bachrach Garage and Taxicab Co. v. Golingco,
39 Phil. 912), unless both parties agree. Even if both parties
agree, however, still the revocation or change in the application
(by crediting the payment to another debt) will not be allowed
if third persons would be prejudiced.
(10) When Application Must Be Made

Application must be made at the time when payment by

the debtor is made, not afterwards. (Powell v. Nat. Bank, 54
Phil. 54)
(11) Examples of How a Creditor Makes the Application

When the debtor without protest accepts the receipt in
which the creditor specified expressly and unmistakably
the obligation to which such payment was to be applied,
said debtor renounced the right of choice. (Kandar u.
Dannug, [CAJ 43 O.G. 3176; see Liggett & Myers Tobacco
Corp. v. Assn. Insurance, et al., L-15643, Oct. 31, 1960)
(b) When monthly statements were made by the bank
specifying the application and the debtor signed said
statements approving the status of her account as thus
sent to her monthly by the bank. (Garcia v. Enriquez, 54
Phil. 423)

(a)

Powell v. Nat. Bank
54 Phil. 54

FACTS: A owed B debts already due. A paid for
one debt, without specifying which. After said payment
had been credited, A complained, stating that he had the
right to choose which debt to pay under the application of
payments.
ISSUE: Is A justified in his complaint?
HELD: No, A is not justified in his complaint. It is
true that originally, he had the right to specify the debt to
which he wanted the payment applied, but since he did not
425

424

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1252

do so at the time of payment, it is as if he has given up his
right. Hence, the legal rules stated in the Civil Code must
be the ones applied, not his application. “Suffice it to say
that such application should have been made at the time
of payment, and not afterwards, when his account with the
bank had already been credited.”
(12) When Application of Payments Cannot Be Availed of
(a)

In the case of a partner-creditor under Art. 1792 of the
Civil Code which reads:

“If a partner authorized to manage collects a
demandable sum which was owed to him in his own name,
from a person who owed the partnership another sum also
demandable, the sum thus collected shall be applied to the
two credits in proportion to their amounts, even though
he may have given a receipt for his own credit only; but
should he have given it for the account of the partnership
credit, the amount shall be fully applied to the latter. The
provisions of this Article are understood to be without
prejudice to the right granted to the debtor by Art. 1252,
but only if the personal credit of the partner should be more
onerous to him.”
(b) The right cannot be invoked by a surety or a solidary
guarantor. (Socony -Vacuum Corp. v. Miraflores, 67 Phil.
304) (The petition for certiorari here was dismissed by the
Supreme Court in Socony-Vacuum Corp. v. Miraflores, 67
Phil. 304.) The reason is that he has only one debt, and even
that is contingent (dependent) on the principal debtor’s
failure to pay.
Reparations Commission v.

Universal Deep-Sea Fishing Corp.
L-21901, L-21996, June 27, 1978
A surety who guarantees a debtor’s debt of P536,428.44
for the amount of P53.643 is still liable for PIO,000. It is wrong
to apply the PIO,000 to the secured portion of the debt as in
the case of application of payments. Said rule on application of
payments is to be used only in case a debtor owes debts in favor
of several creditors.

—

426

Art*. 1253-1264

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1253. If the debt produces interest, payment of the
principal shall not be deemed to have been made until the
interests have been covered.

COMMENT:
(1) Interest Must Be Paid First

The Article is obligatory, that is, the debtor cannot insist
that his payment be credited to the principal instead of the
interest. However, if the creditor agrees, this is all right. (8
Manresa 317)
Rosete, et al. v. Perober Dev. Corp.
CA-GR 61032-R, July 31, 1981

Under the law, payment that is made to a creditor must
be credited to interest (that is already due) ahead of the
principal. The interest can refer not only to interest on amounts
already due but also to interest on future installments, if said
installments are eventually not paid on time.
(2) Effect If Payment Is Credited to the Principal

Reduction of the principal would, of course, result in the
decrease of the total interest collectible.
(3) What Interest Is Supposed to Be Paid
(a)

(b)

interest by way of compensation; and
interest by way of damages due to default.

Reason: The law makes no distinction.
Art. 1254. When payment cannot be applied in accordance
with the preceding rules, or if application cannot be inferred
from other circumstances, the debt which is most onerous to
the debtor, among those due, shall be deemed to have been
satisfied.
If the debts due are of the same nature and burden, the
payment shall be applied to all of them proportionately.
427

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1254

COMMENT:

(f)

(1) Rules in Case No Application of Payment Has Been

Voluntarily Made

(g)

Apply it to the most onerous (in case the due and
demandable debts are of different natures).
(b) If the debts are of the same nature and burden, application
shall be made to all proportionately.

ANS.:
1)

2)

If the debtor makes the application, the payment
should be credited to the first debt. The debtor cannot
insist that the creditor accept it for the second debt
for insofar as the second debt is concerned, it is only a
partial payment. And under the law, a creditor cannot
generally be compelled to receive partial payment
(Art. 1248, Civil Code)

If no application has been made, the law steps
in, and application will be made, not equally but
proportionately. (Art. 1248, Civil Code)

(2) Samples of More Burdensome (More Onerous) Debts

(a)

Older ones in case of running accounts. (Nat. Bank v.
Veraguth, 50 Phil. 253)

(b)

Interest-bearing debts even if the non-interest bearing debt
is older. (Menzi & Co. v. Quing Chuan, 69 Phil. 46)

(c)

Of two interest-bearing debts, that which charges the
higher interest is more burdensome. (This follows from
the very nature of things.)
(d) Debts secured by mortgage or by pledge. (Mission de San
Vicente v. Reyes, 19 Phil. 525; and Sanz v. Lavin Bros., 6
Phil. 299)

(e)

Debts with a penalty clause.
428

Advances for subsistence are more onerous than cash
advances. (Montinola v. Gatila, 97 Phil. 999)
A debt where the debtor is in mora is more onerous than
one where he is not.

(a)

[NOTE: If one debt is for Pl million, and another
is for P2 million and only Pl million is paid, how will the
payment be applied?)

Art. 1254

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(h)

An exclusive debt (not solidary) is more onerous than a
solidary debt. (Commonwealth v. Far Eastern Surety, 83
Phil. 305)
[NOTE: If a principal debtor is guaranteed by a
surety but the guaranty is for a smaller amount, any
partial payment made by the debtor shall be applied to the
portion which is NOT secured, since this exclusive debt is
considered more onerous to him. (Hongkong & Shanghai
Bank v. Aldanese, 48 Phil. 990)]

Hongkong & Shanghai Bank v. Aldanese
48 Phil. 990
FACTS: A set up a bond in the sum of PIO,000, secured
by a surety who agreed to be responsible solidarily with
A but only up to P8,000. A pays Pl,500 to the creditor,
without specifying the application of the payment.

ISSUE: Should this be applied to the P8,000 for which
the surety is also responsible or for the P2,000 which was
not guaranteed?
HELD: The Pl,500 should be applied to the P2.000
which was not guaranteed. This is so because as regards
the principal debtor A, said P2.000 is more onerous than
the P8,000 he solidarily owed together with the surety. This
is so because the surety fixed his liability at an amount
lower than that due from the principal debtor.
[NOTE: The “more burdensome” rule does not apply
when the debtor has made application of payment.
Example:

A owes B two debts, both of which are already due. The
first debt is secured by a mortgage, the second is not. A tells
B that the payment he is now making should be applied
429

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1254

to the second debt, instead of the first. B refuses to accept
such application on the ground that the first debt is more
burdensome to the debtor, and that, therefore, payment
must be applied to it first. Is B correct?
ANS.: No, B is not correct because although it is true
that the mortgage debt is more onerous, still the preference
of the debtor himself must be followed. This is so because
Art. 1254 cannot be applied in case application of payments
has been made by the debtor in accordance with Art. 1252.
Besides, it is not the creditor’s business to go against the
wishes of the debtor who prefers to leave unpaid the more
burdensome obligation here, for the person who might be
prejudiced anyway, if at all, will be the debtor, not the
creditor. (As implied from the case of Garcia v. Enriquez,
40 O.G. {13 S) No. 21, p. 219, 71 Phil. 423, which held that
the more burdensome rule is not applicable when there has
been application of payment.)]
(3) Determination of Which Obligation Is Most Onerous

Sometimes it is easy, and sometimes it is hard to determine
which obligation is the most onerous. The reason is that the
burden may be relative. It follows, therefore, that no hard and
fast rules can be put up, because what may be true in one case
may not be true in another case. (8 Manresa 319) This becomes
more evident when not one circumstance alone is considered
but a combination of different circumstances as when:

—

is secured by a mortgage, non-interest
Obligation A
bearing, and recent.
is unsecured, but maximum interest
Obligation B
bearing, and old.
In such cases, the particular circumstances which have
significant bearing on the case at hand should be observed and
the balancing must be done. However, as a last resort, when
it cannot definitely be determined whether one debt is more
burdensome than the other, the author believes that both will
be considered equally burdensome, and hence payment must be
applied to both pro rata.

—

430

Art 1255

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(4) Problem

If one debt is Pl.2 million and the other is P600.000, and
the debtor without making any application of payment gives
P300.000, how should said payment be applied, presuming that
both are of the same nature and burden?
ANS.: The payment will be applied proportionately. Hence,
P200,000 will be deducted from the first, and P100,000 will be
deducted from the second. The first debt will now be Pl million
and the second will be P500,000. The ratio here of the first debt
to the second debt is thus preserved, namely, 2 is to 1.

Subsection 2
PAYMENT BY CESSION
Art. 1255. The debtor may cede or assign his property to
his creditors in payment of his debts. This cession, unless there
is stipulation to the contrary, shall only release the debtor
from responsibility for the net proceeds of the thing assigned.
The agreements which, on the effect of the cession, are made
between the debtor and his creditors shall be governed by
special laws.

COMMENT:
(1) Cession or Assignment in Favor of Creditors Defined
It is the process by which a debtor transfers all the
properties not subject to execution in favor of his creditors so
that the latter may sell them, and thus apply the proceeds to
their credits. (See 8 Manresa 323; Castan; and Art. 1255)
(2) Kinds or Classes of Assignment
(a)

Legal (This is governed by the Insolvency Law; [Sec. 8, Act
1956]). (The majority of creditors must agree.)

(b)

Voluntary (This is what is referred to in Art. 1255.) (All
the creditors must agree.)

(3) Requisites for Voluntary Assignment
।

(a)
(b)

more than one debt;
more than one creditor;

complete or partial insolvency of debtor,
abandonment of all debtor’s property not exempt from
execution (unless exemption is validly waived by debtor)
in favor of creditors;

cannot be imposed on an unwilling creditor). (Gov’t, v.
Lukban, [CAJ 37 O.G. 1444)
(c)
(d)

(4) Effect of Voluntary Assignment

The creditors do not become the owners; they are
merely assignees with authority to sell. (If ownership is
transferred, this becomes a dation in solutum.)
(b) The debtor is released up to the amount of the net proceeds
of the sale, unless there is a stipulation to the contrary.
(Art. 1255, 2nd sentence) The balance remains collectible.
(c) Creditors will collect credits in the order of preference
agreed upon, or in default of agreement, in the order
ordinarily established by law.
(a)

[NOTE: Some properties should not be assigned, such as:
1)

2)

the family home, whether judicially or extrajudicially
created, save in certain exceptions (See Arts. 223, 226,
Civil Code);
the amount needed by the debtor to support himself
and those he is required by law to support. (See Art.
750, Civil Code) (If such amount is not reserved, the
cession is not void but merely reducible to the extent
that the support is impaired. The party prejudiced can
ask the court for the reduction.) (See by implication

Subsection 3
TENDER OF PAYMENT AND CONSIGNATION

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
(1) "Tender of Payment’ Defined
The act of offering the creditor what is due him together
with a demand that the creditor accept the same.

Soco v. Judge Militant®
GR 58961, June 28, 1983
The objective of notice prior to consignation is to give the
creditor a chance to reconsider his refusal to accept payment.
In this way, consignation and litigation may be avoided. On the
other hand, the purpose of notice after consignation is to enable
the creditor to withdraw the money or goods deposited with the
judicial authorities.
(2) *Consignation’ Defined

The act of depositing the thing due with the court or judicial
authorities whenever the creditor cannot accept or refuses to
433

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1265

accept payment. It generally requires a prior tender of payment.
(Limkako v. Teodoro, 74 Phil. 31)

De Vera, et al. v. Republic, et al.
L-32998, July 12, 1973
If the lessor refuses to accept the payment of rentals,
what the lessee should do is to resort to judicial deposits of the
corresponding amounts.
(3) Requirements of Consignation

PNB v. Chan
820 SCRA 161
(2017)

For consignation to be valid, the debtor must comply with
the following requirements under the law, namely:
1. there was a debt due;
2. valid prior trades of payment, unless the consigna¬
tion was made because of some legal cause provided
in Art. 1256;
3. previous notice of the consignation has been given
to the persons interested in the performance of the
obligation;
4. the amount of thing due was placed at the disposal
of the court; and
5. after the consignation had been made, the persons
interested were notified thereof.
(4) Tender of Payment’ Distinguished from ‘Consignation’

“The clear meaning of these words show their difference.

TENDER is the antecedent of CONSIGNATION, i.e., an act

preparatory to the consignation, which is the principal, and
from which are derived the immediate consequences which the
debtor desires or seeks to obtain. TENDER of payment may be
extrajudicial, while CONSIGNATION is necessarily judicial,
and the priority of the first is the attempt to make a private
settlement before proceeding to the solemnities of consignation.

(8 Manresa 325)

434

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1256

(5) Rules on Payment Must Be Complied With

Tender of payment and consignation, to extinguish the

debtor’s obligation must comply with the requisites provided
in Arts. 1256-1258 of the Civil Code. Thus, if the debtor made
a tender of payment by telegraphic transfer sent to the clerk of
court, and the same was not received by the creditor, but instead
returned to the debtor, it cannot be given effect. (Alemars v.
Cagayan Valley College, Inc., L-11270, April 8, 1958)
Art. 1256. If the creditor to whom tender of payment has
been made refuses without just cause to accept it, the debtor
shall be released from responsibility by the consignation of
the thing or sum due.
Consignation alone shall produce the same effect in the
following cases:
(1) When the creditor is absent or unknown, or does not
appear at the place of payment;
(2) When he is incapacitated to receive the payment at
the time it is due;
(3) When, without just cause, he refuses to give a receipt;
(4) When two or more persons claim the same right to
collect;
(5) When the title of the obligation has been lost.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Tender without Consignation

Tender of payment without consignation does not
extinguish the debt; consignation must follow. (Capalungan u.
Medrano, L-13783, May 18, 1960)
Examples:
(a)

A owes B a sum of money. A gives B the money but B refuses
without just reason to accept it. What should A now do?
ANS.: A must deposit the money in court, since his
tender of payment was refused without just reason. His
deposit in court is called consignation.
435

Art. 1256

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

When a debtor owes money lent him with interest, is it
sufficient to just tender the principal without the interest?
ANS.: No. The tender of the principal must be
accompanied with the tender of the interest which has
accrued. (Fiege and Brown v. Smith, Bell & Co., and
Cowper, 43 Phil. 113) Otherwise, said tender will not be
valid.

Velez v. Avelino
L-48448, Jan. 20, 1084

If a lessee tenders his rent but the lessor refuses to
accept the same, the former must consign the rent in court
(by first filing an action for consignation) or else deposit the
rent in a bank, under the lessee’s name (with the lessee
being notified of the deposit). If this is not done, ejectment
may prosper under BP 25.
(2) When Consignation Is Not Required

In some cases, however, consignation is not required, mere
tender being needed. This is so where there really exists no debt,
no obligation, and where therefore payment is purely voluntary,
that is, the person offering, at his option, could have refused
to offer. This may happen in the case of OPTIONS (Asturias
Sugar Central v. Pure Cane Molasses Co., 60 Phil. 255), or in
the case of a PACTO DE RETRO (Villegas v. Capistrano, 9
Phil. 416; and Rosales v. Reyes, 25 Phil. 495), or in the case of
LEGAL REDEMPTION (De Jesus & Tablan v. Garcia, [CA.] 47
O.G. 2406), where only a right, not a duty, exists. Thus, if one
is granted an option to buy, he may or he may not buy, at his
choice; if one is granted the right to redeem, he may or he may
not redeem also at his own choice.
Villegas v. Capistrano
9 Phil. 416

FACTS: A sold B a piece of land with the right of
repurchase. Within the time given for redemption, A tendered
the amount to B to effect the resale. But B refused. A, however,
did not consign the money in court. A brought an action in court
to compel B to accept the repurchase price. B claims that A
436

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1256

should have deposited the money in court, but since A did not
do so, and since the period of redemption has already lapsed, A
cannot now redeem the property.

ISSUE: Was consignation needed here?
HELD: No. Consignation is not needed. The deposit of the
purchase price is indeed not necessary to compel the purchaser
to make the resale, if he (B, the original purchaser) refuses to
accept the money.
Reason: The articles on consignation refer only to debts.
A here was not a debtor of B, inasmuch as A was free either to
repurchase the property or not.
[NOTE: In the above-mentioned case, it should be noted
that consignation is not required to preserve the right of
redemption. However, there is really no redemption yet unless
payment was actually made or the price consigned. Stated
differently, it is true that consignation of the redemption price
is not necessary in order that the vendor may compel the vendee
to allow the repurchase (Rosales v. Reyes and Ordaneza, 25
Phil. 495), mere tender of payment being enough, if made on
time as a basis for action against the vendee to compel him to
resell. But that tender does not in itself relieve the vendor from
his obligation to pay the price when redemption is allowed by
the court. Hence, mere tender is sufficient to compel redemption
but is not in itself payment. (Paez v. Magno, 83 Phil. 405)]

Co v. PNB
L-61787, June 29, 1982
If the tender of redemption money is refused, there is no
need to consign it in court.
(3) When Creditor Is Justified in Refusing Tender of Payment

The creditor is justified in refusing to accept the tender of
payment if the tender of payment is not valid. To be valid, the
tender of payment must have the following requisites:
(a) It must be made in legal tender (lawful currency). Thus,
tendering by way of a check, even a manager’s check
is made, the defect in tender may be considered cured.
(Miailhe Desbarats v. Varela, L-4915, May 25, 1956)
437

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1266

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

is not legal tender, and the refusal is immediately followed
by consignation

Far East Bank and Trust Co. v. Diaz Realty
GR 138588, Aug. 23, 2001
For a valid tender of payment, it is necessary that
there be a fusion of intent, ability, and capability to make
good each offer, which must be absolute and cover the
amount due.
Though a check is not legal tender, and a creditor may
validly refuse to accept it if tendered as payment, one who,
in fact, accepted a fully-funded check after the debtor’s
manifestation that it had been given to settle an obligation
is estopped from later on denouncing the efficiency of such
tender of payment.

1)

It must include whatever interest is due. (Fiege and Brown
v. Smith, Bell & Co., 43 Phil. 113)

(c)

Generally, it must be unconditional. (PhU. Nat. Bank v.
Relative, et al., 92 Phil. 203) But if made with conditions,
and accepted by the creditor without protest, the creditor
cannot later on prescribe the terms for the validity of the
acceptance which he had already made. (Vidal, Araneta &
Co. v. Uy Ted, [CA] 40 O.G. [Supp. 12], p. 28)

(d)

The obligation must already be due. ( Salvante v. Ubi Cruz,
88 Phil. 236)

(4) Running of Interest
(a)

(b)

If after tender, consignation is made very much later (one
year, for example), interest should run until the principal
is paid. (Llamas v. Abaya, 60 Phil. 502)

Although a certified check is not legal tender, still if it is
tendered, but refused on ground other than the fact that it

—

Is the debt extinguished?

ANS.: No, because among other things, the check
is not legal tender, and therefore the consignation was
not valid.
2)

Did interest run from the date of tender?

ANS.: No, because the tender was made in good
faith; the check could readily be converted to cash in
view of the certification that the debtor really had
sufficient funds in the banks; and finally because after
all, the cause for refusal to accept was a ground other
than that it was not legal tender. (Gregorio Araneta,
Inc. v. Tuason de Paterno and Vidal, 91 Phil. 686)

[NOTE: In Lapuz Sy v. Eufemio, L-10572, Sept. 30,
1958, the Supreme Court held that a check intended to pay
a debt, if refused by the obligee or creditor is not a valid
tender of payment. The fact that in previous years, payment
in check by the debtor was accepted by the creditor does not
place the latter in estoppel to prevent him from requiring
the former to pay his obligation in cash.]
(b)

Art. 1266

[NOTE: In this case, the creditor had refused
the tender because according to him the debt was
not yet due, and he did not want to accept the check
because the tender took place during the Japanese
occupation, and he did not want Japanese money. The
Court held however that the debt was already due,
and, therefore, payable.]
(5) When Consignation Is Sufficient Even Without a Prior

Tender
Consignation alone (without tender) is allowed in the
following cases:

When the creditor is ABSENT or UNKNOWN or DOES
NOT APPEAR at the place of payment. (The creditor need
not be judicially declared absent.)
(b) When the creditor is INCAPACITATED to receive payment
at the time it is due. (The rule does not apply if the creditor
has a legal representative and this fact is known to the

(a)

debtor.)

(c)

When, without just cause, the creditor REFUSES to give
a receipt. [Query: Does this not presuppose a prior tender,
for otherwise, how can there be a refusal?)

(d)

When two or more persons claim the same right to collect.

(e)

When the title (written document) of the obligation has

When the debtor had previously been notified by the
creditor that the latter would not accept any payment.
(Banahaw, Inc. v. Dejarme, 55 Phil. 338)

Rural Bank v. Court of Appeals
L-32116, April 21, 1981
While tender generally precedes consignation,
consignation may be allowed without prior tender in
certain cases (e.g., if there are considerations of equity
as when a prior tender or offer appears to be useless).
(6) Instances Where Art. 1256 Authorizes Consignation Alone

Without Need of Prior Tender of Payment

Cacayarin v. Armed Forces & Police Mutual
Benefit Association, Inc.
696 SCRA311

Art. 1257. In order that the consignation of the thing due

may release the obligor, it must first be announced to the
persons interested in the fulfillment of the obligation.

The consignation shall be ineffectual if it is not made
strictly in consonance with the provisions which regulate

payment.

702 SCRA 1

When a tender of payment is made in such a form that
the creditor could have immediately realized payment if he had
accepted the tender, followed by a prompt attempt of the debtor
to deposit the means of payment in court by way of consignation,
the accrual of interest on the obligation will be suspended from
the date of such tender.

of a Valid Debt
— Existence
a privilege, not an
option, there
is

In the case of an
obligation or a debt.

Example: A was given an option to cancel a contract
provided he paid P600.000. Mere tender is sufficient to
preserve the right to cancel. (See Asturias Sugar Central
v. Pure Cane Molasses, 60 Phil. 255) The same is true in
the case of an option to buy given to a lessee. (See Vda. de
Quirino v. Palarca, L-28269, Aug. 15, 1969)
(b)

In the case of legal redemption, there is as yet no debt
(for this again is a right, not a debt or duty). (De Jesus v.
Garcia, [CA.] 47 O.G. 2406)

(c)

So also, in the case of conventional redemption (this again
is a right, not an obligation). (Rosales v. Reyes, 25 Phil.

(7) Case

Borrostro v. Luna

subsequent notice of consignation

(2) First Requisite

This is where the ground for consignation is such that the
creditor is unknown, or does not appear at the place of payment.

Or is incapacitated to receive the payment at the time it is
due. Another is when, without just cause, he (creditor) refuses
to give a receipt. Still another is when two or more persons
claim the same right to collect. The last is when the title of the
obligation has been lost.

Art. 1267

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

495)

So also, if the alleged debt has prescribed (for here, there
is no more debt).
(e) So also, if the debt is founded on an illegal cause or
consideration, or if for any other reason, null and void.

(d)

441

Art. 1257

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(f)

So also, if the obligation of the debtor is conditional, and
the condition has not been fulfilled. (See Sotto v. Mijares,
L-23563)

(g)

But a mortgage debt is a true and valid debt, and payment
here is a DUTY. (Capalungan v. Medrano, L-13783, May
18, 1960)

(3) Second Requisite

Is Excused
(a)

(b)

— Valid Prior Tender Unless Tender

If tender is required, it must be a valid one. (Therefore, it
must be the very object agreed upon or if a monetary debt,
must be legal tender; unless the cause for refusal is some
other ground, it must be unconditional; also it must include
whatever interest is due (Phil. Nat. Bank v. Relativo, 92
Phil. 208; Araneta, Inc. v. Tuason de Paterno Vidal, 91
Phil. 686; and Fiege and Brown v. Smith, Bell & Co., 43
Phil. 113), or any tax and assessments that may have been
paid properly by the creditor. (Miranda v. Reyes, L-24791,
Aug. 29, 1969) The tender must also be in full satisfaction
of the claim, not merely a partial payment thereof. (Joe’s
Radio and Electrical Supply v. Alto Electronics; and Alto
Surety, L 12376, Aug. 22, 1958)

For the instances when tender is excused. (See par. 2, Art.
1256, Civil Code and comment No. 5 under said Article)
Ludwig Hahn v. Lazatin, et al.
L-11346 and L-11549, June 30, 1959

A consignation to be valid must be preceded by a
refusal without reason to accept the debtor’s tender of
payment. In the case at bar, plaintiffs refusal to accept the
tender of payment on Aug. 4, 1944 was justified because
under the provisions of the contract, the date of maturity
was Jan. 1945. Thus, the consignation made was NULL
and VOID.
(4) Third Requisite
(a)

— Prior Notice to Persons Interested

The law says the consignation “must first be announced to
the persons interested in the fulfillment of the obligation.”
(Art. 1257, par. 1, Civil Code)
442

Art. 1257

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Without such notice, the consignation as a payment is
VOID. (Limkako v. Teodoro, 74 Phil. 313; and Lagonera
v. Macabalag, [CA] 49 O.G. p. 569) The reason is because,
had notice been made, the creditor would have had
opportunity to withdraw the money consigned and thus
make use of it. (Lagonera v. Macabalag, [CA] 49 O.G. p.
569) ONE EXCEPTION to the rule is when any attempt
to give such notice would be useless, as when the creditor
was traveling from place to place and could not be located.
(Pads v. Castro, [CA] 43 O.G. 5119)
(c) Purpose of the notice: To enable the creditor and other
parties interested (such as the mortgagees, pledgees,
guarantors, solidary co-creditors, and solidary co-debtors)
to reconsider the previous refusal, and thus, avoid litigation
by the simple expedient of accepting payment. (Cabanos,
et al. v. Calo, et al., L-10927, Oct. 3, 1958)

(b)

Soco v. Judge Militant®
GR 58961, June 28, 1983

Tender of payment ought to be made in lawful
currency or legal tender. The tender of a check to pay
a monetary obligation is not a valid tender of payment.
Even if in previous years, the creditor had accepted check
payments, this will not put him in estoppel. Thus, he can
still require the debtor to pay in cash.
(d) Needless to say, the notice of consignation may be made by
merely giving notice of the debtor’s intention to take the case
to court, in the event that tender is rejected. (Valenzuela v.
Bakani, L-4689, Aug. 31, 1953) This is to say that the first
notice of consignation may be accomplished simultaneously
with the tender of payment. In the Valenzuela case, two
letters were sent to the creditor, which aside from offering
the price, expressly advised that, if no answer thereto was
received, the proper judicial action would be instituted.
However, it would be better to state in such first notice
the following:
1) that tender had been made (unless excused) on a
specified date;
2) that tender has been unjustifiably rejected;
443

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1267

that deposit in court is being contemplated at a certain
specified date and at a certain specified court (Ochoa
v. Lopez, [CA] GR 7050-R, June 18, 1954)
(e) The notice, however, is NOT essential if the sum to be
deposited is the sum due under a final judgment. (Arzaga
v. Rumbaoa, 91 Phil. 499)
(f) Consignation presupposes the existence of a suit to
compel the creditor to accept. Without a suit, there can
be no consignation, and therefore no discharge. (El Hogar
Filipino v. Angeles, L-11613, Sept. 30, 1958)
3)

Hulganza, et al. v. Court of Appeals
GR 56156, Jan. 7, 1987
FACTS: A is the registered owner of a parcel of land
covered by an original certificate of title issued pursuant
to a free patent. He sold said parcel to B and by virtue of
the sale, the original title was cancelled and a new one
issued in favor of B. A year later, A sued B in the Court of
First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) to compel B to
allow A to redeem said lot under Sec. 119 of Com. Act 141
(Public Land Act). The trial court declared that A has the
legal right to exercise said right at the original purchase
price with interests. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial
court’s decision on the ground that A failed to consign the
amount due at the time they filed the complaint, saying
that the act of merely filing the complaint on the part
of A without consignation of the proper amount within
the period prescribed was an ineffective and incomplete
redemption.
HELD: The bona fide tender of the redemption price
or its equivalent consignation of said price in court — is
not essential or necessary since the filing of the action itself
is equivalent to a formal offer to redeem.

—

(5) Fourth Requisite

—

Actual Deposit with the Proper

Judicial Authorities
(a) It is understood that before a deposit is made, a complaint
against the creditor to compel him to accept has to be first
filed in court.

Art. 1267

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(b)

—

The consignation must be made
1) by depositing the very object that is due (and not
another) (Cabrera v. Lopez, 84 Phil. 834);
2)

3)

with the proper judicial authority which, in certain
case, may include the sheriff (Fabros v. Villa Agustin,
18 Phil. 336);
accompanied by proof that tender had been duly made,
unless tender is excused (Art. 1258, par. 1); and that
first notice of the consignation had already been sent
(Art. 1258, par. 1, Civil Code).
[NOTE: The judicial deposit of the money due
under a final judgment does not require notices to
the proper interested parties. (Arzaga v. Rumbaoa,
91 Phil. 499; and Salvante v. Ubi Cruz, 88 Phil. 236)]

(c)

Effects of the deposit
1)

The property is ‘in custodia legis* (Manejero v.
Buyson Lampa, 61 Phil. 66);

2)

3)

4)

And will, therefore, be exempted from attachment and
execution (Springer v. Odlin, 3 Phil. 344 and 23 C.J.,
p. 357, Sec. 107);
But if the property is perishable by nature, the court
may order the sale of the property (Matute v. Cheong
Boo, 37 Phil. 372);
In the meantime, the debtor, by consigning the thing,
practically makes himself the agent or receiver
of the court, particularly if for some reason, the
property cannot actually be placed in the hands of
the court. (Matute v. Cheong Boo, 37 Phil. 372) This
is particularly true when the object involved is REAL
PROPERTY. The proper thing to do, however, in such
a case is to ask the court for a RECEIVERSHIP (Reyes
and Puno, Outline of Philippine Civil Law, Vol. 4, pp.
130- 131), because ordinarily, unless such deposit is
made, payment cannot be made and consequently,
the obligation would remain in force. (Magsaysay v.
Blanco, 50 O.G. 1152) Indeed, the payment would be
void. (Halili v. Lloret, 95 Phil. 78)
446

444

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHIIJPPINES

Art. 1258

St. Dominic Corp. v. IAC
GR 67207, Aug. 26, 1985
Where the court’s decision states that the
balance of the purchase price must be made within 60
days from receipt hereof, the judgment debtor must
pay the amount within a reasonable time thereafter
and not from the time the judgment becomes final.
If the judgment creditor refuses to receive the
payment, the proper procedure is for the judgment
debtor to consign the same with the court also
within the 60-day period or within a reasonable time
thereafter. The fact that the judgment debtor tried to
reach an agreement with the judgment creditor after
the promulgation of the decision does not affect the

,

finality of the judgment.

— Subsequent or Second Notice
After the Deposit)

(6) Fifth Requisite

(Made

This is required by the law which says: “The consignation
having been made, the interested parties shall be notified
thereof.” (Art. 1258, par. 2, Civil Code)
(b) This is mandatory and, therefore, without such subsequent
notice, the consignation is VOID (Tiaoqui v. China
Insurance & Surety Co., Inc., [CA] 45 O.G. 2558) unless the
amount due is as a consequence of a FINAL JUDGMENT,
inasmuch as the law refers only to a contractual debt, not
to one decreed by the court. (Salvante v. Ubi Cruz, 88 Phil.
236; and Arzaga v. Rumbaoa, 91 Phil. 499)
(c) FORM: It would be advisable to issue a formal notice;
however, it has been held that the mere filing of the
complaint and the service of summons on the defendant¬
creditor, accompanied by a copy of the complaint, can
take the place of said second notice. (Andres v. Court of
Appeals, 47 O.G. 2876; Limkako v. Teodoro, 74 Phil. 313;
and Dungao v. Roque, L-4140-4141, Dec. 29, 1951)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1259-1260

The consignation having been made, the interested
parties shall also be notified thereof.

COMMENT:
How Consignation Is Actually Made
(a)

The things due must be deposited with the proper judicial
authorities (while ordinarily the cashier or the cash officer
should be the person to issue the receipt for the money
consigned, a temporary receipt issued by the clerk of court
for said deposit would suffice). (See Yap v. Tingin, L-18943,
May 31, 1963)

(b)

There must be PROOF that:
1)
tender had previously been made (general rule);
2)

or that the creditor had previously notified the debtor
that consignation will be made (in case tender is not
required).

(a)

Art. 1258. Consignation shall be made by depositing the
things due at the disposal of judicial authority, before whom
the tender of payment shall be proved, in a proper case, and
the announcement of the consignation in other cases.
446

Art. 1259. The expenses of consignation, when properly
made, shall be charged against the creditor.

COMMENT:
(1) Creditor Generally to Bear Expenses of Consignation

Reason why the creditor pays the expenses of the
consignation if properly made: Clearly, this consignation is due
to the creditor’s fault, for had he accepted, there would not have
been any need for the consignation. If not properly made, the
consignation expenses are, of course, chargeable to the debtor.
(2) The Expenses

The expenses include those for the preservation or
warehousing of the goods pending litigation. (Matute v. Cheong
Boo, 37 Phil. 372)

Art. 1260. Once the consignation has been duly made,
the debtor may ask the judge to order the cancellation of the
obligation.
447

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Alt. 1260

Before the creditor has accepted the consignation, or
before a judicial declaration that the consignation has been
properly made, the debtor may withdraw the thing or the sum
deposited, allowing the obligation to remain in force.

COMMENT:
(1) Effects If Consignation Has Been Duly Made

If the consignation is DULY (properly) made:
(a) The debtor may ask the judge to order the cancellation of
the obligation.
(b) The running of interest is suspended.
(c) However, it should be observed that before the creditor
ACCEPTS, or before the judge declares that consignation
has been PROPERLY MADE, the obligation REMAINS.
(Padua v. Rizal Surety, 47 O.G. Supp. No 12, p. 308)
[NOTE: No judicial approval is needed if ALL the
essential requisites for a valid consignation are present.
This is particularly true when the deposit and the records
of the case are accidentally destroyed, but there is NO
reason shown why the consignation should be considered
improper. (Sia v. Court of Appeals, 92 Phil. 335»

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(4) Effect of Dismissal of the Case

If the case in which consignation was made is dismissed by
the court, the consignation naturally would produce NO effect.
(Bravo v. Barreras, 92 Phil. 679)
[NOTE: The same thing results if there is failure to
reconstitute the case, for here there would be WAIVER.
(Valenzuela v. De Aquino, L-2262, Aug. 31, 1949; and Chua Kay
v. Lim Chang, L-5995, May 18, 1956)]
(5) Query

Suppose one of the essential requisites for consignation
is not present, may the debtor ask for the cancellation of the
obligation?

ANS.: Yes, provided the creditor does not object. This would
have the effect of a waiver. (See Limkako v. Teodoro, 74 Phil.
313)

(6) When Debtor May Withdraw the Thing or Sum Consigned
(a)

1956)

(3) Effects of Improper Consignation

If the consignation was improperly made, the obligation
remains, because the consignation is NOT EFFECTIVE
as a payment. (Bravo v. Barreras, 92 Phil. 679)
(b) If at the time of consignation the debt was already due,
and the requisites for consignation are absent, the debtor
is in DEFAULT.

(a)

448

As a matter of right:

before the creditor has accepted the consignation (See
Gamboa v. Tan, L17076, Jan. 29, 1962);
2) or before there is a judicial declaration that the
consignation has been properly made. (Here, the
obligation and the accessory stipulations remain.)
[NOTE: The right is given the debtor because he
still owns the thing; however, he bears the expenses. The
co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties cannot object.]
1)

(2) Risk of Loss

If the consignation is judicially approved OR if all the
essential requisites are present OR if the creditor has signified
his acceptance, the creditor bears the loss; otherwise, it is the
debtor who bears the burden. (See Sia v. Court of Appeals, 92
Phil. 335; see also Chua Kay v. Lim Chang, L-5995, May 18,

Art. 1260

(b)

As a matter of privilege:
When after consignation had been properly made
(the creditor having accepted or the court having declared
it proper), the creditor authorizes the debtor to withdraw
the thing. (Art. 1261, Civil Code)

(7) Query

How can the creditor prevent the debtor from exercising
the RIGHT to withdraw the thing consigned?
449

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ANS.: By immediately accepting the consignation with or
without reservations. If he accepts without reserving his right to
further claims such as damages, this would be a case of WAIVER.

(1) What “Loss” Includes
“Loss" under this Section includes “impossibility of

450

moral impossibility (impracticability). (See Art. 1267, Civil
Code)

The obligation remains.
The creditor loses any preference (priority) over the thing.
The co-debtors, guarantors, and sureties are RELEASED
(unless they consented).
[NOTE: The co-debtors referred to are the solidary co¬
debtors, not the joint ones, for their liabilities are distinct.

FACTS: The company and its employees, in a collective
agreement, agreed that “employees shall be provided with work
on Sundays at time and a half (150% wages); and that in the
event no work on Sundays is available through no fault of the
employees, they shall be paid the equivalent of their wages as
if they had performed work for that day.” Three months later
the Blue Sunday Law was passed, prohibiting work on Sundays,
The employees contended they should nevertheless be paid on
Sundays since this prohibition by the law was not their fault.

—

HELD; The employees should not be paid because the
company was prohibited by law to provide them work on
Sundays. The company’s duty to provide work on Sundays was
extinguished by the law, so it is unfair to require it to pay the
employees who after all would not be working on said days.
Indeed, the obligation of the employer to furnish work became

a legal impossibility.

Art. 1262

House v. Sixto de la Costa
68 Phil. 742

*•'

FACTS: House sued Bush, and pending decision House
obtained an attachment of Bush’s property. Bush cancelled
the attachment by posting a P2,000 bond, secured by a Surety
Company. The bond stipulated that should Bush lose, Bush
would return the property to the sheriff, and if Bush would not
do so, the Surety Company would be liable.
Subsequently, by virtue of an agreement. Bush turned
over to House the property previously attached, said property
to be sold at a public auction. In said auction, House purchased
the property. Later the pending case was terminated, and the
trial court awarded House the sum of P2,000. House wanted the
money from Bush, but since Bush could not pay. House sued
the Surety Company for said amount. The trial court, presided
over by Judge Sixto de la Costa, said that the Surety Company
was not liable anymore because the bond could not be complied
with (the giving of the property to the sheriff) since House was
already the owner of the property; and that it was House’s act
of purchasing the property that prevented compliance with the
terms of the bond. House then brought this action. Decide.
HELD: The trial judge was correct. The Surety Company
could have been held liable had not the petitioner House
prevented compliance with the terms of the bond by his own act
of purchasing the property. But since House did this, he cannot
recover from said Surety Company.
Art. 1262. An obligation which consists in the delivery of
a determinate thing shall be extinguished if it should be lost
or destroyed without the fault of the debtor, and before he
has incurred in delay.
When by law or stipulation, the obligor is liable even for
fortuitous events, the loss of the thing does not extinguish
the obligation, and he shall be responsible for damages. The
same rule applies when the nature of the obligation requires
the assumption of risk.

452

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1262

COMMENT:
(1) Two Kinds of Obligations “To Give”

An obligation to give may consist of an obligation:
(a)

to give a generic thing;

(b)

or to give a specific thing.
[NOTE: The first is NOT extinguished by loss or by a
fortuitous event because "genus never perishes “(Art. 1263,

Civil Code)]

(2) Effect of Loss on an Obligation to Deliver a Specific Thing

(a)

General rule

— the obligation is extinguished.

[NOTE: The loss must be after the obligation has been
incurred, because if the loss had been PRIOR, there would
not be any subject matter and therefore there would not
have been any obligation at all.]
[NOTE: If the mortgaged property is lost, the
mortgagor being the owner of it bears the loss ( res perit
domino). He is, of course, still liable for the debt, since
this obligation is monetary, and therefore may be said to
be generic in character. (Warner, Barnes & Co. v. Flores,
L-12377, March 29, 1961; and Lawyers Cooperative
Publishing Co. v. Tabora, L-21263, April 30, 1965)]
(b)

Exceptions:
The obligation is not extinguished in the following
cases:
1) if the debtor is at fault (Art. 1262, par. 1, Civil Code);
2)
when the debtor is made liable for a fortuitous event
because:
a) of a provision of law;
b) of a contractual stipulation;
c)
the nature of the obligation requires the
assumption of risk on the part of the debtor.
[NOTE: Of course in the above-mentioned cases, the
obligation to deliver the specific thing itself is extinguished
453

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1262

for there is no more thing to be given. BUT said obligation

is converted into a MONETARY OBLIGATION FOR
DAMAGES. It is in this sense that we say that the
“obligation” remains.]

(3) When Claim of Loss Must Be Made

If under the terms of a contract a claim for loss or damage
(of goods carried on a vessel) must be made only after the date
of discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel will
a claim before such date of discharge be regarded as premature
and speculative?

—

It depends:
The claim is premature and speculative if made without
basis.
(b) The claim would, however, be proper if the claim was made
because of prior information or discovery of shortage of
or damage to the goods. (New Hampshire Fire Insurance

(a)

(4) Examples of Instances When the Law Requires Liability

Even in the Case of a Fortuitous Event
(a) when the debtor is in default (mora)(Art. 1165, Civil Code);
(b) when the debtor has promised to deliver the same thing
to two or more persons (parties) who do not have the same
interest (Art. 1165, Civil Code);
(c) when the obligation arises from a crime. (Art. 1268, Civil
Code);
(d)

when a borrower (of an object) has lent the thing to another
who is not a member of his own household (Art. 1942(4],

Civil Code);
(e)

when the thing loaned has been delivered with appraisal
of the value, unless there is a stipulation exempting the
464

Art. 1263

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

borrower from responsibility in case of a fortuitous event
(Art. 1942(3], Civil Code);

(f)

when the payee in solutio indebiti is in bad faith. (Art. 2159,
Civil Code)

Art. 1263. In an obligation to deliver a generic thing,
the loss or destruction of anything of the same kind does not
extinguish the obligation.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Loss on Obligation to Deliver a Generic Thing

The obligation continues to exist because a generic thing
does not really perish (genus nunquam perit “genus never
perishes”).

—

(2) Exceptions

If the generic thing is delimited (like “50 kilos of sugar
from my 1999 harvest" when such harvest is completely
destroyed) (“delimited generic thing").
(b) If the generic thing has already been segregated or set
aside, in which case, it has become specific.

(a)

(3) Monetary Obligations

An obligation to pay money, such as one under a pension
plan, is generic. Here, failure to raise funds is not a defense
(Phil. Long Distance Tel. Co. v. Jeturian, L-7756, July 30, 1955;
and Reyes v. Caltex, 47 O.G. 1193), nor is it excused just because
the debtor has lost certain specific property due to a fortuitous
event. (Ramirez v. Court of Appeals, 52 O.G. 770)

Republic of the Philippines v. Jose Grijaldo
L-20240, Dec. 31, 1965
FACTS: A borrower obtained a loan from a bank. The loan
was embodied in several promissory notes. As security, the
borrower executed a chattel mortgage on his standing crops. Said
crops were, however, subsequently destroyed by the Japanese
forces during the last war.
ISSUE: Is the borrower still liable for the loan despite the
destruction of the crops by someone else?
455

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts, 1284-1266

HELD: Yes, the borrower is still liable, for his obligation
was not to deliver determinate things (the crops) but to deliver
a generic thing (money). The amount of money representing the
value of the crops, with interest, cannot be said to have been
lost, for the account can still be paid from sources other than
the mortgaged crops.
Art. 1264. The courts shall determine whether, under the
circumstances, the partial loss of the object of the obligation
is so important as to extinguish the obligation.

COMMENT:
Effect of Partial Loss
In certain cases, partial loss may indeed be equivalent to a
complete loss, such as the loss of a specific fountain pen minus
the cover. In other cases, the loss may be insignificant. Hence,
judicial determination of the effect is needed.

Art. 1265. Whenever the thing is lost in the possession
of the debtor, it shall be presumed that the loss was due to
his fault, unless there is proof to the contrary, and without
prejudice to the provisions of Article 1165. This presumption
does not apply in case of earthquake, flood, storm, or other
natural calamity.

COMMENT:
(1) Presumption That Loss Was Due to Debtor’s Fault
Note that the debtor is presumed to be at fault. If a person
for example is entrusted with several heads of cattle and he
cannot account for some missing ones, he is presumed to be at
fault. (Palacio v. Sudario, 7 Phil. 275; see Malayan Insurance
Co., Inc. v. Manila Port Service, L-26700, May 15, 1969)
(2) When Presumption Does Not Apply

The presumption of fault does not apply in the case of a
natural calamity. Although fire is not a natural calamity, if a
tenant is able to prove that the fire caused in his apartment was
purely ACCIDENTAL, he is NOT liable. (Lizares v. Hernaez and
Alunan, 40 Phil. 981)
456

Art. 1266

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1266. The debtor in obligations to do shall also be

released when the prestation becomes legally or physically
impossible without the fault of the obligor.

COMMENT:
(1) Loss in Personal Obligations

This Article refers to a case when compliance of a personal
obligation becomes, without the debtor’s fault
(a) a legal impossibility;
(b) or a physical impossibility.

—

(2) When the Impossibility Must Exist

The impossibility must be AFTER the constitution of
the obligation. If it was before, there is nothing to extinguish.
(8 Manresa 354) (Note the word “becomes”). Hence, if the
performance was impossible right at the start, the obligation
must be regarded as VOID.
(3) Examples of Impossibility

Legal impossibility
The furnishing of work on Sundays when the same
by law (Asia Bed Factory v. National Bed
prohibited
is
Worker’s Union, et al., L-9126, Jan. 31, 1957); refusal of the
government to issue a building permit. (Tabora v. Lazatin,
L-5245, May 29, 1953)
(b) Physical impossibility
To install a motor in a ship that was lost after the
perfection of the contract but prior to such installation.
(See Milan v. Rio y Olabarrieta, 45 Phil. 718)

(a)

Milan v. Rio y Olabarrieta
45 Phil. 718
FACTS: A sold a half-interest in his motorboat to B. It was
agreed that the price to be paid by B would be used in installing
a motor on the vessel. Later, the vessel was destroyed by a
fortuitous event.
ISSUE: Is B’s obligation to pay the price extinguished?
457

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1266

HELD: B must still pay because his obligation to pay ia
generic. This is so even if there is no more use of installing the
motor since the boat has already been destroyed by the fortuitous
event. It should be noted here that it is not the paying that has
become impossible (for indeed, it still is); it is merely the act to
be performed after the paying that has become impossible. Thus,
the obligation or prestation (to pay) remains.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1267. When the service has become so difficult as to
be manifestly beyond the contemplation of the parties, the
obligor may also be released therefrom, in whole or in part.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Difficulty beyond the Parties’ Contemplation

This Article refers to moral impossibility or impracticability
a
due to change of certain conditions (rebus sic stantibus
treaty or agreement remains valid only if the same conditions
prevailing at the time of contracting continue to exist at the time
of performance).
[NOTE: This is also referred to as the doctrine of “the
frustration of the commercial object” (Re Badische Co. [1921]
2 Ch. Eng 331), “frustration of enterprise.” (Reyes and Puno,
Outline of Civil Law, Vol. IV, p. 239, citing Corbin on Contracts,
Vol. 6,pp. 1353-1361)]

—

(4) Effect of Subjective Impossibility

If the act is subjectively impossible (for the debtor himself)
but otherwise objectively possible (for all others), is the obligation
extinguished?

ANS.: It depends. Usually the obligation subsists (Reyes
47 O.G. 1193), unless personal considerations are
Caltex,
v.
involved such as when only a particular company is prohibited
by law to furnish work on a certain day.
(5) Effect of Loss through a Fortuitous Event in Reciprocal

Obligations
(a)

General rule: The obligation that was not extinguished by
the fortuitous event remains. (Example: If after perfection a
building that was sold is destroyed by lightning, the buyer
must still pay, for he bears the loss even if the building had
not yet been delivered to him.) (See Art. 1191, Civil Code)

(b)

Exceptions:
Some exceptions are provided for by the law, such as:
1) In the case of lease
If the object is destroyed,
both the lease and the obligation to pay rent are
extinguished. (See Art. 1655, Civil Code)
2) In contracts for a piece of work Here, the worker or
contractor cannot successfully ask for the price if the
thing be lost by a fortuitous event prior to delivery.
Note here that the risk is on the worker. (See Art.
1717, Civil Code)

(2) Non-applicability to Real Obligations

—

Article 1264 applies to partial impossibility.
468

—

It will be noted that Art. 1267 speaks of a “service" a
personal obligation. Thus, real obligations (“to give”) are not
included within its scope. If for example a lease contract is
entered into for say 20 years at a fixed rental per month, would
the lessor be justified in increasing said rent to 800% if the taxes
or assessments are also increased by 800%? It is submitted that
in view of the existence of the contract, no such increase can
be effected without the lessee’s consent. After all, the increase
in taxes or in assessments cannot be said to be “beyond the
contemplation of the parties.” If upon the other hand, the lessee
will have his own house constructed in say five years, and will,
thus, not need the premises anymore, he will necessarily still
be bound by the contractual agreement.

Iloilo Jar Corp. v. Comglasco Corp.
815 SCRA 1
(2017)

FACTS: To evade responsibility, Comglasco Corp, explained
that by virtue of Art. 1267 of the Civil Code, it was released from
the lease contract.
469

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1267

ISSUE: Is Comglasco’s contention correct?
HELD: No. Comglasco’s position fails to impress because
Art. 1267 applies only to obligations to do and not to obligations
to give.

For the Supreme Court “[cjonsidering that Comglasco’s obligation of paying
rent is not an obligation to do, it could not rightfully invoke
Art. 1267... Even so, its position is still without merit as
financial struggles due to an economic crisis is not enough
reason for the courts to grant reprieve from contractual
obligations.”
(3) Comment of the Code Commission

“The general rule is that impossibility of performance
releases the obligor. However, it is submitted that when the
service has become so difficult as to be manifestly beyond the
contemplation of the parties, the court should be authorized
to release the obligor in whole or in part. The intention of the
parties should govern and if it appears that the service turns
out to be so difficult as to have been beyond their contemplation,
it would be doing violence to that intention to hold the obligor
still responsible." (Report of the Code Commission, p. 133)
(4) Examples of Moral Impossibility

The duty to construct a railroad when such construction
was possible but very dangerous to life and property, is excused
by the law; therefore, failure to grind sugar cane in view of the
non-construction of the railroad does NOT give rise to damages.
(8 Manresa 355 and Labayen v. Talisay-Silay Milling Co.,
52 Phil. 440) However, if instead of extreme danger there is
only proved the existence of mere inconvenience, unexpected
impediments, or increased expenses, the same would not be
enough to relieve a debtor from his “bad bargain.” (Castro, et
al. v. Longa, 89 Phil. 581)
[NOTE: For Art. 1267 to apply, the following requisites
must concur:
(a) The service must become so difficult that it was manifestly
beyond the contemplation of BOTH parties. (Art. 1267)
460

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1268

Thus, it is not enough that neither party actually
anticipated or foresaw the difficulty; the difficulty could
not POSSIBLY have been anticipated or foreseen.
(b) One of the parties must ask for relief. (TS, May 17, 1941)
(c)

The object must be a future service with future unusual
change in conditions. (Naturally, an aleatory contract
or one dependent on chance, in view of the risks being
foreseen, does not come under the scope of Art. 1267)]

Art. 1268. When the debt of a thing certain and
determinate proceeds from a criminal offense, the debtor shall

not be exempted from the payment of its price, whatever may
be the cause for the loss, unless the thing having been offered
by him to the person who should receive it, the latter refused
without justification to accept it

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Loss in Criminal Offenses

This Article gives one instance where a fortuitous event
does not extinguish the obligation.
(b) Exception: When the creditor (the offended party in the
crime) is in MORA ACCIPIENDI.

(a)

(2) Illustrative Questions

(a)

A commits the crime of theft, and is asked to return the car
stolen to its owner B. If, before the car is delivered to B, it is
destroyed by fortuitous event, is A's liability extinguished?

ANS.: No, A’s liability is not extinguished.
Reason: A’s obligation to deliver the car arose from a
criminal offense, and in such a case, the rule is, he is liable
even if the loss occurs because of a fortuitous event.
(b) Suppose in Problem (a), A had previously asked the owner
to accept the car, but the owner without any justifiable
reason refuses to accept the car, do you believe A to still be
responsible if, let us say, the car is lost later by a fortuitous
event?
461

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1269

ANS.; In this case, the criminal could no longer be

(c)

liable because here the creditor is in mora accipiendi. This
is the exception to the rule.
If the creditor refuses to accept the thing due from the
criminal, what should the latter do?
ANS.: The criminal may either consign the thing or
else keep the thing in his possession. If he does the latter
thing, he is still obliged to care for it with due diligence, but
this time he will not be liable if the thing is lost through a
fortuitous event. (2 Manresa 361)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1270

ISSUE: Is the insurance money liable for the damages
sustained by the second vessel?
HEED: Yes. “The vessel lost was insured, and the defendant
collected the insurance. That being the case, the insurance
money substitutes the vessel, and must be used, so far as
necessary, to pay the judgment rendered in this case.”
Section 3

CONDONATION OR REMISSION OF THE DEBT

COMMENT:

Art. 1270. Condonation or remission is essentially
gratuitous, and requires the acceptance by the obligor. It may
be made expressly or impliedly.
One and the other kinds shall be subject to the rules
which govern inofficious donations. Express condonation
shall, furthermore, comply with the forms of donation.

(1) Transfer of Rights from the Debtor to the Creditor in

COMMENT:

Art. 1269. The obligation having been extinguished by
of the thing, the creditor shall have all the rights of
loss
the
action which the debtor may have against third persons by

reason of the loss.

Case of Loss

(1) ‘Remission or Condonation’ Defined

Example:

S is obliged to deliver his car to B. But X destroys the
car. B has a right to sue X. The right is given to B instead of S
because otherwise S would unduly profit in that he will gain two
things: first, his obligation to give the car or its value is already
extinguished; second, he would be allowed to recover from X. It
is obvious that S must not unduly profit at the expense ofB.
(2) “Rights of Action”

"Rights of action" include the insurance indemnity that may
have been received. (See Urrutia & Co. v. Baco River Plantation
Co., 26 Phil. 632)

Urrutia & Co. v. Baco River Plantation Co.
26 Phil. 632

FACTS: A vessel collided with another vessel. The first
vessel was at fault, but it sank. However, the owner of the vessel
collected insurance.

It is “the gratuitous abandonment by the creditor of his
right.” (4 Sanchez Roman 422)
(2) Example

Gloria owes Edgardo P5 million. When the debt matured,
Edgardo told Gloria that she need not pay the debt since he was
condoning it. Gloria, in turn, expressed her gratitude. Here, the
debt has been extinguished by remission.
(3) Essential Requisites for Remission

There must be an agreement (since acceptance of the offer
is required). (Art. 1270)
(b) The parties must be capacitated and must consent
(therefore, it is beyond the power of the courts or of
Congress to condone interest unless the creditor consents).

(a)

463

462

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1270

—

There must be subject matter (object of the remission
otherwise, there would be nothing to condone).
(d) The cause or consideration must be liberality (for
remission is ESSENTIALLY GRATUITOUS). (Otherwise,
the act may be a dation in payment, or a novation, or a
compromise.) (8 Manresa 329-330)
(e) The obligation remitted must have been demandable at the
time of remission (otherwise, the remission is useless). (8

(c)

Manresa 330)
(0 The remission must not be inofficious (otherwise, it would
be reducible, so that the legitimes of the compulsory heirs
would not be impaired).
QUERY: The law mentions “inofficious donations,"
but does not refer to the other grounds for revocation
of donations such as ingratitude. Now then, may the
remission be revoked on said other grounds?
ANS.: Yes, because remission is essentially a donation
(Castan), despite the exclusive mention of “inofficious.”
(g) Formalities of a donation are required in the case of an
express (not implied) remission. (Art. 1270)
Example: A remission of an obligation to give land
must be in a public instrument in order to be valid. (Art.
749, Civil Code)
QUERY: May an express remission defective in form
be considered an implied remission?
ANS.: No, otherwise, the requirement of the law on
express remission would be rendered useless. Thus, an
express remission, not made in due form, cannot affect the
creditor if it is withdrawn in due time. It would affect him
only when new acts of waiver confirm the express purpose
of the former, as one of the bases on which tacit or implied
remission may rest. (8 Manresa 344)
[NOTE: If remission is made in a will, it is essential
that the will be VALID extrinsically, and PROBATED.
After all, such a remission is made EXPRESSLY. The will,
be it remembered, actually partakes of a donation mortis

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1270

Waivers or remissions are not to be presumed generally.
They must be clearly and convincingly shown, either
by express stipulation, or by acts admitting of no other
reasonable explanation. (Arrieta v. NARIC, L15645, Jan.
31, 1964)

(4) Classes of Remission
(a)

As regards its effect or extent:
1) total

(b)

partial (only a portion is remitted or the remission
may refer only to the accessory obligations)

As regards its date ofeffectivity:
1)

inter vivos (during life)

2)

mortis causa (after death)
(This must have the formalities of a will and the will

must be probated.)
(c)

As regards its form:

2)

implied or tacit (this requires no formality) (conduct
is sufficient)
express or formal (this requires the formalities of a
donation if inter vivos-, of a will or codicil if mortis
causa)

(5) Remission Must Be Gratuitous

Lyric Film Exchange v. Cowper
(CJL) 86 O.G. 1642

FACTS: A bought furniture from B on credit. On the date
of payment, B told A he would condone the debt provided that
A would return the furniture which has been furnished him. A
agreed. Is there remission here?
HELD: The Court of Appeals said that this is, strictly
speaking, not the satisfaction of an obligation but the
condonation or remission of a debt.

(6) Effect If Remission Is Not Accepted by the Debtor

This would not be remission; however, if the creditor does
not really collect within the Statute of Limitations (period of
prescription), the debt may be said to have been extinguished
by PRESCRIPTION.
(7) What Remission Includes

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

civil liabilities. No motion for reconsideration was filed by the
offended party.

ISSUE: Was the imposition of civil liability proper, despite
the reservation?

HELD: No, the imposition of the civil liability was not
proper because:
(a) there was the reservation as to the civil aspect;
(b)

the mere failure to file a motion for reconsideration
does not necessarily result in waiver or abandonment.
Abandonment requires a more convincing quantum of
evidence than mere forbearance to actually file the civil
action, especially when we consider the fact that the same
could be filed even after the decision in the criminal case
had been rendered;

(c)

proof should be given with respect to the amount.

Francisco Puzon v. Marcelino Gaerlan, et al.
L-19571, Dec. 31, 1965

FACTS: A conjugal two-storey building, owned by a
husband and wife living separately from each other, was leased
in favor of certain tenants, but the contract of lease stipulated
that the rents would be paid to the husband alone. The wife sued
for part of said rentals. In the course of the trial, a compromise
was agreed upon between the spouses to the effect that the
wife would pay the husband P35.000 in consideration of a
waiver made by the husband to any right in said property and
to any accounting of the rentals the property would earn. The
compromise was then approved by the court.
ISSUE: Does the waiver to this property dissolve the
conjugal partnership between the spouses?
HELD: No, for the waiver applies only to the property
mentioned in the agreement. With reference to all ot her conjugal
properties, as well as future properties, the conjugal partnership
still remains.
(8) When Waiver or Abandonment Is Defective

Jovencio Luansing v. People
& Court of Appeals
L-23289, Feb. 28, 1969

FACTS: In a criminal action for seduction, the offended

party expressly reserved the right to file a separate civil action.
The CFI (now RTC) found the accused guilty, and imposed
466

Art. 1271

Art. 1271. The delivery of a private document evidencing a
credit, made voluntarily by the creditor to the debtor, implies
the renunciation of the action which the former had against

the latter.
If in order to nullify this waiver it should be claimed
to be inofficious, the debtor and his heirs may uphold it by
proving that the delivery of the document was made in virtue
of payment of the debt.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Delivery of Private Document Evidencing the

Credit
The Article speaks of a “private document,” not a public
one because in the case of the latter, a copy is easily obtainable,
being a public record. Note that with the delivery of the private
instrument, a remission or renunciation is presumed.
(2) Example

Steffi made a promissory note in favor of Agassi in the
amount of P100 million. After some time, Agassi voluntarily
467

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1272

delivered the promissory note to Steffi without collecting the
P100 million. Steffi is now in possession of said note. There is
a disputable presumption that there has been a remission. The
presumption is merely disputable and not conclusive because it
may be that the instrument was delivered only for examination
by Steffi or for collection. ( See Lopez Vito v. Tambunting, 33 Phil.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(b)
(c)

Note again here that the law speaks of a private document.
The presumption is disputable or prima facie, for the law
itself says “until the contrary is proved.” (Art. 1272; see
Lopez Vito v. Tambunting, 33 Phil. 226)
Lopez Vito v. Tambunting
33 Phil. 226

226)

(3) Implied Remission

It should be noted that Art. 1271 gives us an example of
an implied remission.
[NOTE: The voluntary destruction by the creditor of the
instrument is likewise another form of implied remission.]
[NOTE: But the mere fact that the creditor has omitted a
certain debt or the name of the debtor from an inventory made
by him does not imply a tacit remission. (TS, Nov. 19, 1915)]
(4) Falsehood Not Allowed

It must not be thought that the second paragraph allows
a falsehood. The debtor and his heirs now claim that the
instrument was delivered not because of payment BUT only
when indeed there was a payment. The law must not be construed
to allow an immoral actuation.
(5) Conflict of Presumption

It should be noted likewise that as between the presumption
of remission and the presumption of payment, the first
(remission) ordinarily prevails.
Art. 1272. Whenever the private document in which the
debt appears is found in the possession of the debtor, it shall
be presumed that the creditor delivered it voluntarily, unless
the contrary is proved.

COMMENT:
(1) Presumption of Voluntary Delivery
(a)

While Art. 1271 gives a presumption of remission, Art. 1272
gives a presumption of voluntary delivery.
468

Art. 1272

FACTS: A owed B a sum of money. B sent a receipt signed
by him to A through a collector, who was supposed to collect a
debt. A did not pay, however, although he kept the receipt. The
creditor (B) was able to prove that the only reason he had sent
the receipt was to collect the money.
ISSUE: Is there remission here?
HELD: No, there is no remission here; the creditor has
been able to prove the real reason why the debtor had in his
possession the receipt. Hence, the presumption of remission has
been overcome.
(2) Rule If the Instrument of Credit Is Still in Creditor’s

Hands
If the instrument of credit is still in the hands of the
creditor, this is evidence that the debt has not yet been paid,
unless the contrary be fully proved. (Toribio v. Fox, 34 Phil. 913)
To rebut the presumption, ordinarily, a receipt of payment must
be presented. (Pinon and Manalac v. Osorio, 30 Phil. 365)
(3) Presumption in Joint or Solidary Obligations

Effect if the obligation is joint, or if it is solidary.

Example: A and B owe C P100.000, evidenced by a private
document.
(a) If the private document is found in the possession of A,
who is a joint debtor, what is the presumption?
ANS.: The presumption is that only A’s debt has been

remitted.

Reason: A’s debt is not P100.000 but only P50.000; in
other words, his debt is really distinct from B’s debt.
469

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1273-1274
(b)

(c)

If the private document is found in the possession of A who
is a solidary debtor, what is the presumption?
ANS.: Since this is a solidary obligation, the presump¬
tion is that the whole obligation (not merely A’s share) has
been remitted.
In both cases, may the presumption be rebutted?
ANS.: Yes, the presumption in both cases can be
overcome by superior contrary evidence. (8 Manresa 379)

Art. 1273. The renunciation of the principal debt shall
extinguish the accessory obligation; but the waiver of the
latter shall leave the former in force.

COMMENT:
(1) Renunciation of Principal Extinguishes Accessory, But
Not Vice-Versa
This follows the rule of “accessory follows the principal.”

Art. 1276

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(2) Reason for the Presumption

It is essential in pledge that the thing be delivered to the
creditor, or to a third person by common agreement.
(3) Possession by a Third Person

The law says “or of a third person who owns the thing."
Therefore, if the third person does not own the thing, the
presumption does not arise. As a matter of fact, the stranger
may just have found it or it may have been delivered to him only
for safekeeping.

Section 4

CONFUSION OR MERGER OF RIGHTS
Art. 1275. The obligation is extinguished from the time
the characters of creditor and debtor are merged in the same
person.

COMMENT:
(1) “Merger or Confusion’ Defined

(2) Example

A remission of the penalty does not remit the principal
obligation, but if the principal debt is condoned, the penalty is

also condoned.

It is the meeting in one person of the qualities of creditor
and debtor with respect to the same obligation. (94 Sanchez
Roman 421)

Art. 1274. It is presumed that the accessory obligation
of pledge has been remitted when the thing pledged, after
its delivery to the creditor, is found in the possession of the
debtor, or of a third person who owns the thing.

(2) Reason or Basis for Merger

COMMENT:
(1) Remission of Pledge
(a) Note here that only the accessory obligation of pledge is

presumed remitted. The principal obligation (the

(3) Requisites of a Valid Merger

remains in force.
(b)

The presumption is only disputable, for the debtor or the
third person may be in possession of the property by theft
or because it had been sent for repairs, or for similar causes.

If a debtor is his own creditor, enforcement of the obligation
becomes absurd, since one cannot claim against himself. (8

Manresa 349)

(a)

It should take place between the principal debtor and
creditor. Therefore, confusion of the creditor with the
person of the guarantor does not extinguish the principal
obligation. (Art. 1276) Of course, in a case like this, the
accessory obligation of guaranty is extinguished.
Therefore also, there can be no confusion or merger
if the debtor and creditor represent (different) juridical

entities even if the officers of both are the SAME.
(Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa MRR v. Credit Union
etc., L-14332, May 20, 1960)

The merger must be clear and definite. (Testate Estate of
Mota v. Serra, 47 Phil. 464)
(c) The very obligation involved must be the same or identical
(because if the debtor acquires certain rights from the
creditor with respect to other things, there is no merger).
(Testate Estate of Mota v. Serra, 47 Phil. 464)
[NOTE: If an heir is a debtor of the deceased, merger
does not necessarily follow, for other creditors may be
prejudiced.]

(b)

(4) Example of Merger

A makes a check payable to bearer, and hands the check
to C, who hands it to D who finally hands it to A. Here A owes
himself. This is a clear case of merger, and hence, the obligation
of A is extinguished.
(5) Effect of Transfer of Rights

Mere transfer to a third person of rights belonging to both
the debtor and the creditor BUT not the credit as against the
debt does not result in merger. (Testate Estate of Mota v. Serra,
47 Phil. 464)
Example:

A and B were co-owners of a piece of property worth
Pl,000,000. For some repairs thereon, B paid P200.000. Because
they were co-owners, A had to share in said expenses, and so
A owed B P100.000. A sold his share in the property to C and
B also sold his share in the property to C. Later B brought this
action to recover P100.000 from A. A claimed that since C is now
the owner of the property, C owes himself, and therefore said
merger had extinguished his debt to B. Should A pay B?
ANS.: Yes, A should pay B, since there was really no merger
here. What had been sold to C were the half shares of each of
the co-owners, or P500,000 worth of property from each. C did
472

Art. 1276

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

not acquire the indebtedness of P100.000 for the repairs, hence
there can be no merger with reference to that debt. (As implied
from the case of Testate Estate of Mota v. Serra, 47 Phil. 464)
(6) Extinction of Real Rights

Real rights, such as usufruct over property, may be
extinguished by merger when the naked owner himself become
the usufructuary.
[NOTE: This is also denominated “consolidation of

ownership."]

Example:

A had two brothers B and C. A gave a parcel of land to B
in usufruct (right to the use and right to the fruits), and the
same parcel to C in naked ownership. If later C donates the
naked ownership of the land to B, B will now have the full
ownership (his ownership is consolidated), and it is as if merger
had resulted.
(7) Revocability of Confusion or Merger

If the reason for the confusion ceases, the obligation is
REVIVED.
(8) Effect If Mortgagee Becomes the Owner of the Mortgaged

Property

If the mortgagee becomesthe owner of the property that had
been mortgaged to him, the mortgage is naturally extinguished,
but the principal obligation may remain. (See Yek Ton Lin Fire
v. Yusingco, 64 Phil. 1062)
Example:

I borrowed Pl,000,000 from my brother, and as security,
I mortgaged my land in his favor. Later, I sold the land to him.
The mortgage is extinguished but I still owe him Pl,000,000.
[NOTE: Had he assigned his credit of Pl,000,000 to a friend
and the friend assigned the credit to me, both the principal
obligation and the mortgage are extinguished.]

debt in favor of B still exist? The answer is evidently YES,
for extinguishment of the accessory obligation does not by
itself extinguish the principal obligation which is the loan.
This time, however, it would be a case of a loan without
security.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Merger on Guarantors

“Accessory follows the principal" (the guaranty being
considered the accessory obligation); hence, if there is merger
with respect to the principal debt, the guaranty is extinguished;
note, however, the second sentence of the Article.

Art. 1277. Confusion does not extinguish a joint obligation
except as regards the share corresponding to the creditor or
debtor in whom the two characters concur.

COMMENT:
Merger in Joint Obligations

(2) Examples

A owes B P700.000, guaranteed by C. B assigns his credit
to X. X assigns the credit to Y. Y assigns the credit to A.
A’s obligation is extinguished and C is released from his
obligation as guarantor.
(b) A owes B P700,000, guaranteed by C. B assigns his credit
to X. X assigns his credit to Y. Y assigns his credit to C,
the guarantor. Does A still have to pay C?
ANS.: Yes. However, the contract of guaranty is
extinguished, but not A’s obligation to pay the P700.000.
(a)

(3) Problems

A owes B with C’s land given as security by way of
mortgage. Later B becomes the owner of one-third of C’s
land (said one-third share having been sold or donated to
him by C). Is the mortgage extinguished?
ANS.: The mortgage is extinguished regarding B's
one-third share of the land because of merger. This is
evident because otherwise, if the debt is not paid, B would
hold his own property as security and this would be absurd.
However, the mortgage continues to subsist on the twothirds of the land still belonging to C.
(b) Suppose in the preceding problem, B became the owner of
the whole of C’s land, what happens to the mortgage?
ANS.: For the same reason hereinabove given, the
mortgage is completely extinguished. However, does A’s

A and B jointly owe C Pl,000,000. If C assigns the entire
credit to A, A’s share is extinguished, but B’s share remains. In
other words, B would still owe A the sum of P500.000. In a joint
obligation, the debts are distinct and separate from each other.

Section 5
COMPENSATION
Art. 1278. Compensation shall take place when two
persons, in their own right, are creditors and debtors of each

other.

COMMENT:
(1) ‘Compensation’ Defined

—

“It is a sort of balancing (cum ponder to weigh together*)
between two obligations; it involves a figurative operation
of weighing two obligations simultaneously in order to
extinguish them to the extent in which the amount of one
is covered by the other.” (8 Manresa 366)
(b) It is the extinguishment in the concurrent amount of the
obligations of those persons who are reciprocally debtors
and creditors of each other. (Castan, Derecho, Civil
Espanol, p. 61) (See Mondragon Personal Sales, Inc. v.
Sola, Jr., 689 SCRA 18)

law, and extinguishes reciprocally the two debts as soon as
they exist simultaneously, to the amount of their respective
sums.” (11 La Ann, 520; 16 La Ann, 181; cited in the case
of Yap Unki v. Chua Jamco, 14 Phil. 602)

(2) Usefulness of Compensation

In effect, it is a specie of abbreviated payment which gives
to each of the parties a double advantage:
(a) “facility of payment;
(b) guaranty for the effectiveness of the credit because if one
of the parties pays even without waiting to be paid by
the other, he could easily be made a victim of fraud or
insolvency.” (Castan, Derecho, Civil Espanol, pp. 61-62)
Indeed, it is simplified or abbreviated payment,
because the two debts are extinguished without requiring
the transfer of money or property from one party to the
other. (TS, May 11, 1926)
[NOTE: In banking operations, a “clearing house”
takes care of compensation in banking accounts.]
(3) ‘Compensation* Distinguished from ‘Payment’

(a)

While payment must be complete and indivisible as a
rule, in compensation, partial extinguishment is always
permitted. (See 8 Georgi, Teoria de las Obligaciones, pp.

(b)

A set-off or counterclaim works as a sort of judicial
compensation, provided that the requirements of the Rules
of Court, particularly on Counterclaims and/or Cross¬
claims are observed. (See Sec. 2, Rule 9, Revised Rules of
Court)

(6) Kinds or Classes of Compensation
(a)

According to its effect or extent:

While payment involves action or delivery, true compensation
(legal compensation) takes place by operation of law.

(4) ‘Compensation’ Distinguished from ‘Merger’

As to the number of persons:
In confusion, there is only one person in whom is
merged the qualities of creditor and debtor.
In compensation, there must be two persons who are
mutually creditor and debtor to each other.
(b) As to the number of obligations:
In confusion, there can be only one.
In compensation, there must be two.

also Art. 1283, Civil Code)
Facultative here, one of the parties has the choice of
claiming the compensation or of opposing it (perhaps
because not all the requisites of legal compensation
are present).
Example of Facultative Compensation:
A owes B Pl million demandable and due on
Jan. 12, 2004. B owes A Pl million demandable and
due on or before Jan. 31, 2004. On Jan. 12, 2004, B,
who was given the benefit of the term, may claim
compensation because he could then choose to pay his
debt on said date, which is “on or before Jan. 31, 2004."

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1278

If, upon the other hand A claims compensation, B can
properly oppose it because B could not be made to pay
until Jan. 31, 2004.
[NOTE: It should be observed that while
facultative compensation is unilateral and does not
require mutual agreement, voluntary or conventional
compensation requires mutual consent.]
(7) When Compensation Cannot Exist

Under the law, the two persons concerned are creditors and
debtors of each other; therefore, a debtor of a corporation cannot
compensate his debt with his share of stock in the corporation,
since the corporation is not considered his debtor. (Garcia v.
Lim Chu Sing, 59 Phil. 562) It would have been different had
the corporation really been his debtor as when he had paid it a
sum greater than the value of his shares. (Brimo v. Goldenberg
and Co., Inc., 40 O.G. [6th S] No. 10, p. 199)

Garcia v. Lim Chu Sing
59 Phil. 562
FACTS: Defendant is the owner of shares of stock of
the Mercantile Bank of China amounting to PIO,000. Later,
the defendant borrowed money from the Bank amounting to
P9.605.17 with interest thereon at 6% per annum. The debt
was to be paid in installments. One of the conditions of the debt
contract is that in case of the debtor’s default in the payment of
any of the installments as they become due, the entire amount
or the unpaid balance thereof will become due and payable on
demand. The defendant defaulted in the payment of several
installments and plaintiff brought this action to recover the
impaid balance. The defendant pleaded compensation.
ISSUE: Can defendant’s debt be compensated with the
shares of stock he owns?
HELD: There can be no compensation because regarding
the shares of stock, there is no relationship of debtor and creditor.
Said the Supreme Court:
“A stockholder’s indebtedness to a banking corporation
cannot be compensated with the amount of his shares in the
478

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1278

same institution, there being no relation of creditor and debtor
with regards to such shares.”
“According to the weight of authority, a share of stock or
the certificate thereof is not an indebtedness to the owner nor
evidence of indebtedness, and, therefore, it is not a credit. (14
Corpus Juris, p. 388, Sec. 511) Stockholders, as such, are not
creditors of the corporation. (14 Corpus Juris, p. 848, Sec. 1289)
It is the prevailing doctrine of the American courts, repeatedly
asserted in the broadest terms, that the capital stock of a
corporation is a trust fund to be used more particularly for the
security of the creditors of the corporation, who presumably deal
with it on the credit of its capital stock. (14 Corpus Juris, p. 383,
Sec. 505) Therefore, the defendant-appellant Lim Chu Sing, not
being a creditor of the Mercantile Bank of China, although the
latter is a creditor of the former, there is no sufficient ground to
justify a compensation.” (Acufla Co Chongco u. Dievas, 12 Phil.
250)

Brimo v. Goldenberg and Co., Inc.
69 Phil. 502

FACTS: Brimo was a stockholder and a treasurer of a
corporation. Brimo paid a sum greater than the value of his
shares, and was therefore a creditor to that extent (the excess,
but not as to the value of the shares, for here, he is not a creditor).
As treasurer, Brimo owed the corporation a certain sum.

ISSUE: May Brimo's credit be compensated with his
indebtedness as treasurer?
HELD: Yes, because both are debts and credits.
Francia v. IAC
GR 67649, June 28, 1988
Internal revenue taxes cannot be the subject of
compensation. Reason: Government and taxpayer “are not
mutually creditors of each other” under Art. 1278 of the Civil
Code and a “claim for taxes is not such a debt, demand, contract
or judgment as is allowed to be set-off.”

There can be no offsetting of taxes against the claims that
the taxpayer may have against the government. A person cannot
479

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1278

refuse to pay a tax on the ground that the government owes him
an amount equal to or greater than the tax being collected. The
collection of a tax cannot await the result of a lawsuit against
the government.
Tan v. Mendez
GR 138669, June 6, 2002
FACTS: The memorandum shows that some unencashed
checks returned to respondent to allegedly offset the dishonored
check were from the Baao ticket sales which are separate from
the ticket sales of respondent. Here, respondent only acted as
an intermediary in remitting the Baao ticket sales.

HELD: Because of respondent’s role as mere intermediary,
he is not a debtor of petitioners. No compensation can take place
between petitioners and respondent as the latter is not a debtor
of the former insofar as the two checks representing collections
from the Baao ticket sales are concerned.

Carlos v. Abelardo
GR 146504, April 9, 2002
FACTS: Defendant-husband in invoking the defense
of compensation argues that if indeed he and his spouse are
indebted to plaintiff, the latter could have applied their share
in the proceeds or income of the corporation to the concurrent
amount of the alleged loan, instead of giving the amount of
P3 million to them.

ISSUE: Is this argument tenable?
HELD: This argument is untenable. As Art. 1278 indicates,
compensation is a sort of balancing between two obligations. In
the instant case, compensation is a sort of balancing between two
obligations. In the instant case, plaintiff and defendant-husband
are not debtors and creditors of each other. Even granting that
the defendant-husband’s claim to the profits of the corporation is
justified, still compensation cannot extinguish his loan obligation
to plaintiff because under such assumption, the defendant is
dealing with the corporation and not with the plaintiff in his
personal capacity. Hence, compensation cannot take place.
480

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1279

Art. 1279. In order that compensation may be proper, it
is necessary:
(1) That each one of the obligors be bound principally,

and that he be at the same time a principal creditor of the
other;
(2) That both debts consist in a sum of money, or if the
things due are consumable, they be of the same kind, and also
of the same quality if the latter has been stated;
(3)

That the two debts be due;

(4) That they be liquidated and demandable;
(5) That over neither of them there be any retention or
controversy, commenced by third persons and communicated
in due time to the debtor.

COMMENT:
(1) Legal Compensation or Compensation by Operation of
Law
The requisites enumerated under Art. 1279 are those
for LEGAL compensation; voluntary compensation in general
requires no requisite except that the agreement be voluntarily
and validly entered into.
(2) Affirmative Requisites for Legal Compensation

Items (1), (2), (3) and (4) of Art. 1279 are the affirmative
requisites.
(3) Negative Requisites for Legal Compensation

Over neither of the debts must there be any retention or
controversy commenced by third persons and communicated
in due time to the debtor. (Par. 5, Art. 1279) Thus, there
can be no legal compensation when one’s claim against
another is still the subject of court litigation. (Miailhe v.
Halili, L-16587, Oct. 31, 1962)
(b) There must have been no waiver of the compensation (such
waiver could have been validly agreed on, since this would
not be contrary to public policy). (Manresa)

(a)

481

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1279

(c)

The compensation of the debts must not have been
prohibited by law. The compensation of the following are
prohibited:
1) debts arising from a depositum (except bank deposits,
which are by law considered as loans to the bank)
(Art. 1287; Art. 1980, Civil Code);
2) debts arising from the obligations of a depository
(Art. 1287, Civil Code);
3) debts arising from the obligations of a bailee in
commodatum (like the borrower of a bicycle)
(Art. 1287, Civil Code);
4) debts arising from a claim for future support due by
gratuitous title (Art. 1287, Civil Code);
5)

6)

debts consisting in civil liability arising from a penal
offense (Art. 1288, Civil Code);
damages suffered by a partnership through the fault
of a partner cannot be compensated with profits and
benefits which he may have earned for the partnership
by his industry. (Art. 1794, Civil Code) Reasons:
Since the partner has the duty to obtain benefits
for the firm, and a duty not to be at fault, there can
be no compensation because both are duties, and
the partner is the debtor in both instances. (See 11

Manresa 377).
[NOTE: The courts may, however, equitably
lessen this responsibility of the partner, if, through
the partner’s extraordinary efforts in other activities
of the partnership, unusual profits have been realized.
(Art. 1794, Civil Code)]
(4) The First Affirmative Requisite

“That each of the obligors be bound principally, and that
he be at the same time a principal creditor of the other.”
(a) Firstly, there must be a relationship of debtor and creditor.
(b)

Secondly, there must be two debts and two credits.
482

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1279

Thirdly, they must generally be bound as principals (and
not in their representative capacity).

(c)

Example:

G, as guardian for W, is a creditor of D. D in turn is a
, creditor of G who owes him a personal debt. There can be
NO compensation because it is W who is the real creditor,
not G.
•t

Another example:

A, debtor of two partners, cannot compensate the debt
with what the partnership itself owes her.(Escano v. Heirs
ofEscano, 28 Phil. 73)

Another example:

'

A debtor owes a creditor Pl million but the creditor
owes the debtor's guarantor Pl million. The debtor cannot
claim compensation. (HOWEVER, a guarantor may set
up compensation as regards what the creditor may owe
the principal debtor. The reason is simple: If the principal
obligation is extinguished, the accessory obligation of
guaranty is also extinguished.) (See Art. 1280, Civil Code)

'

(5) The Second Affirmative Requisite

“That both debts consist in a sum of money, or if the things
due are consumable (fungible), they be of the same kind, and
also of the same quality if the latter has been stated.”
(a) The word “consumable" must be taken to mean “fungible*
(susceptible of substitution, if such be the intention).
(b)

Example:

A owes B a fountain pen (generic). B owes A also a
fountain pen (generic). There can be compensation here
because the objects are fungible (although not consumable).
[NOTE: Had specific fountain pens been agreed upon,
there can be no compensation (legal compensation).]
[NOTE: Ten sacks of com cannot be compensation
(legal compensation) for ten sacks of rice.]
483

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1279

(6) The Third Affirmative Requisite

“That the two debts be due.”
(a) “Due" means that the period has arrived, or the condition
has been fulfilled. On the other hand, “demandable" may
refer to the fact that neither of the debts has prescribed,
or that the obligation is not invalid or illegal.
(b) Solita owes Edmundo Pl million payable April 1, 2021.
Edmundo owes Solita Pl million payable June 8, 2005.
Can there be legal compensation on April 1, 2021?
ANS.: No, for one of the debts is not yet due. However,
there can be voluntary compensation upon agreement. (See
Art. 1282, Civil Code)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ISSUE: Is a set-off proper?
HELD: There can be NO set-off or compensation for
the alleged damage caused was still unliquidated, and could
not yet therefore be set-off against the government liability.
“Unliquidated damages” cannot be said to be “debts” owing the
government.

Salinap v. Judge del Rosario
GR 50638, July 25, 1983

Compensation takes place only if both obligations are
liquidated. Therefore, it cannot take place if one’s claim against
the other is still the subject of court litigation.

Perez v. Court of Appeals

(7) The Fourth Affirmative Requisite

“That they be liquidated and demandable.”

For the meaning of “demandable* see comment No. 6(a).
(b) If one of the debts has already prescribed, there can be no
compensation (8 Manresa 411) for the simple reason that
said debt is no longer demandable.
(c) “Liquidated” debts are those where the exact amount has
already been determined, though not necessarily in figures
since capacity of being arrived at by simple arithmetical
processes would be enough. If damages are asked for,
and the amount is disputed, the debt cannot be said to be
already a “liquidated” one. (Compania General de Tabacos
v. French and Unson, 39 Phil. 34) Once liquidated by a
judgment, however, a set-off asked for in a counterclaim
would be proper. (8 Manresa 409-410)

(a)

Compania General de Tabacos v.
French and Unson
39 Phil. 34

FACTS: A private common carrier transported gasoline
for the government (Bureau of Supply) for P322.93. The Auditor
General, however, wanted to deduct from said amount the
damages the carrier had caused to the cargo of gasoline, but
said damages were still undetermined and unliquidated.
484

Art. 1280

L-56101, Feb. 20, 1984

If the loan instruments intended to be set off against
each other are not yet due and demandable, there cannot be
compensation.
(8) The First Negative Requisite

“That over neither of the debts must there be any retention
or controversy commenced by third persons and communicated
in due time to the debtor.”
Example:
A owesB P100.000, and B owes A P1OO.000, but A’s credit
of PIOO.OOO has been garnished by C who claims to be an unpaid
creditor of A. B has been duly notified of the controversy. There
can be NO compensation here. (See Rule 57, Sec. 8, Revised
Rules of Court on Garnishment) Any possible compensation is
in the meantime suspended. If C wins his claim, there can be
no compensation; if he loses, the controversy is resolved, and
compensation can take place. (8 Manresa 407)

Art. 1280. Notwithstanding the provisions of the
preceding article, the guarantor may set up compensation as
regards what the creditor may owe the principal debtor.
485

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1281-1282

COMMENT:
(1) Guarantor May Set Up Compensation With Respect to
Principal Debt
(a) This is an exception to Art. 1279, par. 1, because a guarantor
is SUBSIDIARILY, not principally, bound.
(b) Reason for the law: Extinguishment (partial or total) of
principal obligation extinguishes (partially or totally) the
guaranty (which is merely an accessory obligation).
(2) Examples

A owes B P500.000. C is the guarantor of A. B owes A
P100.000. When B sues A and A cannot pay, for how much
will C be liable?
ANS.: C will be liable for only P400.000, because he can
set up the P100.000 credit of A as the basis for partial
compensation.
(b) A owes B P500.000. C is the guarantor of A. B owes
C P500.000. When B sues A for the P500,000, may A
successfully put up the defense of compensation in that,
after sill, his creditor (B) owes C the same amount?
ANS.: There can be no compensation here because
in the obligation which C guaranteed for A, he (C) is not
bound in his own right. Neither is A the creditor of B.
[NOTE: If A cannot pay and B sues the guaranty,
C will not be liable anymore because the obligation of
guaranty has been extinguished by compensation.]
(a)

Art. 1281. Compensation may be total or partial. When
the two debts are of the same amount, there is a total
compensation.

COMMENT:

Art 1283

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
(1) Conventional or Voluntary Compensation

This applies to conventional or voluntary compensation.
As a matter of fact, the requisites mentioned in Art. 1279
do not apply.
(c) It is sufficient in conventional compensation that the
agreement or contract which declares the compensation
should itself be valid; thus among other things, the parties
must have legal capacity and must freely give their consent.

(a)

(b)

(2) ‘Legal Compensation’ Distinguished from ‘Conventional

Compensation’

Mondragon Personal Sales, Inc. v. Sola, Jr.
689 SCRA 18
Legal compensation takes place by operation of law
when all the requisites are present as opposed to conventional
compensation which takes place when the parties agree to
compensate their mutual obligations even in the absence of
some requisites.
Art. 1283. If one of the parties to a suit over an obligation
has a claim for damages against the other, the former may set
it off by proving his right to said damages and the amount

thereof.
COMMENT:
(1) Judicial Compensation or Set-off
(a) This refers to judicial compensation or set-off. Pleading
and proof of the counterclaim must be made.
All the requisites mentioned in Art. 1279 must be present,
except that at the time of pleading, the claim need not yet
be liquidated. The liquidation (or fixing of the proper sum)
must be made in the proceedings.
(c) Unless pleading and proof are made, the court cannot of
its own accord declare the compensation. This is because of
“the supplicatory character of our civil procedure.” (Reyes

Total or Partial Compensation
The Article is true for all the different kinds of compensation,

Castan, De Buen) The compensation takes place by the
judgment, as to the date the compensation was pleaded.
(Reyes and Puno, id.)
(2) Jurisdiction of the Court Regarding the Value of the

Demand
General Rule: The jurisdiction of the court depends upon
the totality of the demand in all the causes of action, irrespective
of whether the plural cases arose out of the same or different
transactions. (Soriano v. Omilia, 51 O.G. No. 7, p. 3465; and
Campos Rueda Corporation v. Sta. Cruz Timber Co., 52 O.O.
No. 3,p. 1387)

Art 1285

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(2) Prevention of Unfairness

To avoid unfairness if rescission or annulment is later on
decreed by the court, it is as if NO compensation ever took place.
The decree thus acts retroactively.
Example:
A owes BPI million. Later, A forced B to sign a promissory
note for Pl million in A’s favor. The first debt is valid; the second
is voidable. But if all the requisites for legal compensation are
present, both debts are extinguished since B’s debt is not yet
annulled. This is obviously unfair if, later on, B’s debt is annulled
by the court. Thus here, the compensation that has taken place

will be cancelled.

Exceptions:
(a)

Where the claim joined under the same complaint are
separately owed by, or due to, different parties, in which
case each separate claim furnishes the jurisdictional test.
(Argonza, et al. v. International Colleges, L-3884, Nov. 29,
1951; and Soriano y Cia v. San Jose, 47 O.G. 12th Supp.,
p. 156)

(b)

Where not all the causes of action joined are demands or
claims for money. (Felix Vda. de Rosario v. Justice of the
Peace of Camiling, et al., L-9284, July 31, 1956, 52 O.G.
No. 5152)
[NOTE: Consequential damages and attorney’s
fees, when properly claimed and recoverable as an item of
damage, are not excluded from the jurisdictional amount.
(Suanes v. Almeda-Lopez, 73 Phil. 573)]

Art. 1284. When one or both debts are rescissible or
voidable, they may be compensated against each other before
they are judicially rescinded or avoided.

COMMENT:
(1) Compensation in the Case of Rescissible or Voidable

Debts

Rescissible or voidable debts are valid until rescinded or
voided; hence, compensation is allowed.

Art. 1286. The debtor who has consented to the assignment
of rights made by a creditor in favor of a third person, cannot
set up against the assignee the compensation which would
pertain to him against the assignor, unless the assignor was
notified by the debtor at the time he gave his consent, that he
reserved his right to the compensation.
If the creditor communicated the cession to him but
the debtor did not consent thereto, the latter may set up the
compensation of debts previous to the cession, but not of
subsequent ones.
If the assignment is made without the knowledge of the
debtor, he may set up the compensation of all credits prior
to the same and also later ones until he had knowledge of the
assignment.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Assignment on Compensation of Debts

Under Art. 1290, “when all the requisites mentioned in
Art. 1279 are present, compensation takes effect by operation
of law, and extinguishes both debts to the concurrent amount,
even though the creditors and debtors are not aware of the
compensation."Thus, compensation takes place automatically or
ipso jure. Now then, if AFTER compensation has taken place one
489

488

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1285

of the extinguished debts is ASSIGNED to a stranger, ordinarily
this would be a useless act since there is nothing more to assign.
The defense of compensation could then be set up.
There is ONE exception to said rule, and this takes place
when the assignment (after compensation has already taken
place) was made WITH THE CONSENT of the debtor. Such
consent operates as a WAIVER of the rights to compensation.

The exception to the exception occurs when “at the time he
gave his consent, he RESERVED his right to the compensation.”
(See 8 Manresa, pp. 413-414)
(2) The Three Cases Covered by the Article
(a)

The assignment may be made with the consent of the

debtor. (Par. 1, Art. 1285)
(b)

(c)

The assignment may be made with the knowledge but
without the consent (or against the will) of the debtor. (Par.
2, Art. 1285)

ANS.: C can collect from A the whole Pl,000,000. A cannot
set up the defense of compensation as of the P200,000 in view
of his consent to the assignment.
[NOTE: Had A reserved his right to the compensation, A
would be forced to give only P800,000.]
[NOTE: Par. 1 of Art. 1285 applies whether the consent
to the cession was BEFORE or AFTER the debts became
compensable. (8 Manresa 413-414)]

Examples:
(a)

—

The Assignment May Be Made with the
Consent of the Debtor [See also Comment No. (1) under
this Article]

Effect: Compensation cannot be set up (because there has
been consent and, therefore, a waiver).

Exception: If the right to the compensation (that has already
taken place) is reserved.
Example:

A owes B Pl,000,000. B in turn owes A P20O.0O0. Because
both debts are already due, and because all other requisites for
legal compensation are present, both debts are extinguished
automatically up to the amount of P200.000. Later however, B,
with the consent of A, assigned his (B’s) Pl,000,000 credit to C.
How much can C collect successfully from A?

490

—

Assignment Made with the Knowledge
but without the Consent or Against the Will of the Debtor.
Effect: Compensation can be set up regarding debts previous
to the cession or assignment. This refers to debts maturing before
the assignment (that is, before the NOTICE); hence here, legal
compensation has already taken place.

(4) The Second Case

The assignment may be made without the knowledge of
the debtor. (Par. 3, Art. 1285)

(3) The First Case

Art. 1285

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

A owes B Pl,000,000. B owes A P200.000. Both debts are
already due. Later B, with the knowledge but without the
consent (or against the will) of A, assigned the Pl,000,000
credit to C. How much can C successfully collect from A?

ANS.: If A sets up the defense of partial compensation
as to previously maturing debts, C can collect only P800.000.
There had already been compensation with respect to the

P200.000.
(b)

A owes B Pl,000,000 due on April 2; B owes A P200.000
due also on April 2. On Feb. 4 (when there was no legal
compensation yet), B assigned his Pl,000,000 credit to C,
with the knowledge but without the consent of A. On April
2, how much can C successfully collect from A?
ANS.: Pl,000,000, because if at all there would be
compensation here, it took place after the assignment,
not before. It does not matter that the P200.000 had been
incurred prior to the cession, for when the law speaks of
“debts previous to the cession,” it refers to debts maturing
before the cession (not to debts incurred prior to such cession
which have not yet matured before said cession).
491

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1286

—

Assignment Made without the
Knowledge of the Debtor
Effect: Debtor can set up compensation as a defense for
all debts maturing PRIOR to his knowledge of the assignment
(whether the debts matured before or after the assignment).

(6) The Third Case

[NOTE: The crucial time here is the time of knowledge of
the assignment, not the time of assignment itself.}

Example:

A owes B Pl,000,000. B owes A in turn P200.000. Both
debts are already due. Later, B assigns the Pl,000,000 credit to
C, without the knowledge of A. This assignment was made on
July 1. On July 15, a P250.000 debt of B in favor of A matured.
A learned of the assignment on Aug. 1. On Aug. 23, a P150.000
debt of B in favor of A matured. Later C asks A to pay his debt.
How much can C successfully collect from A?
ANS.: C can collect P550.000 because A can set up the
defense of partial compensation regarding the P200.000
and the P250.000 debts, debts which had matured and were
therefore already compensable PRIOR to his knowledge of the
assignment. But A cannot set up the last debt of P150.00O for
partial compensation because this matured only after he knew
of the assignment.
(6) Reason for the Article

Art. 1287

(b)

“Indemnity for expenses of transportation" (this applies to
transportation of the goods or of the object).

(c)

“Indemnity for expenses of exchange” (this refers to
monetary exchange, in case the debts are money debts).

(2) Example

A owes B Pl million payable in Manila and B owes A
Pl million payable in England. Whoever claims compensation
must pay for the exchange rate of currency.
(3) ‘Foreign Exchange’ Defined

Foreign exchange has been defined as the conversion of an
amount of money or currency of one country into an equivalent
amount of money or currency of another. (See Dr. Edgardo C.
Paras, Economics for Lawyers, 1993, pp. 594-603)
Art. 1287. Compensation shall not be proper when one of
the debts arises from a depositum or from the obligations of
a depository or of a bailee in commodatum.
Neither can compensation be set up against a creditor
who has claim for support due by gratuitous title, without
prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 301.

COMMENT:

Article 1285 has for its purpose the prevention of fraudulent
deprivation of the benefits of total and partial compensation. (8
Manresa 413-414)
Art. 1286. Compensation takes place by operation of law,
even though the debts may be payable at different places,
but there shall be an indemnity for expenses of exchange or
transportation to the place of payment.

(1) When Legal Compensation Cannot Take Place

This Article speaks of the instances when legal compensation
cannot take place, such as:
(a) When one debt arises from a depositum (not bank deposit,
for this is really a loan). (Gullas v. Phil. Nat. Bank, 62 Phil.
519 and Art. 1980, Civil Code)
[NOTE: The purpose is to prevent breach of trust and
confidence.]

COMMENT:
(1) Compensation by Operation of Law
(a)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

[NOTE: It is the depositary who cannot claim
compensation. The depositor is allowed to so claim.]

This applies to compensation by operation of law.
492

493

Art 1287

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

When one debt arises from the obligations of a depositary.
[NOTE: This has the same reason as the preceding
one. Again, the depositor is given the right to claim
compensation.]
When one debt arises from the obligations of a bailee in
commodatum (the borrower of property who pays nothing
for the loan).
[NOTE: Again, the reason here is to prevent a breach
trust.]
of
[NOTE: The lender may claim compensation; the
borrower is NOT allowed to do so.]

(c)

[NOTE: In the three instances given above, since the

depositor and the lender have an option to claim or not to
claim compensation, we have clear instances of facultative
compensation. (See Comment No. 6 {b-4} under Art. 1278)]
(d) When one debt arises because of a claim for support due
to gratuitous title.
[NOTE: Support in arrears may be compensated
(Art. 301, par. 2, Civil Code) but not future support, for
this is “vital to the life of the recipient.” (Report of the Code

depositor is that of debtor and creditor. (See Art. 1980,
Civil Code and Gullas v. Phil. Nat. Bank, 62 Phil. 519)
(b) A asked B to keep Pl,000,000 for him. Now, A is indebted to
B for the amount of P400,000. When A asks for the return
of his money, B gives him only P600.000, alleging partial
compensation. Is B correct?
ANS.: No, B is not correct because the Pl,000,000
deposit with him is not subject to compensation. (Art. 1287,
1st par., Civil Code)
(3) Obligations of a Depositary

The law says that compensation is not proper when one of
the debts arises from the obligations of a depositary. Now, what
are some of these obligations of a depositary?

ANS.:
(a)

The depositary is obliged to keep the thing safely and to
return it, when required, to the depositor, or to his heirs and
successors, or to the person who may have been designated
in the contract. (Art. 1972, Civil Code)

(b)

Unless there is a stipulation to the contrary, the depositary
cannot deposit the thing with a third person. (Art. 1973,

Commission)]

[NOTE: In the foregoing discussion, please observe
that while compensation cannot be made use of by one party
(e.g., the depositary), compensation may be claimed by the
other party (e.g., the depository). This kind of compensation,
whereby only one side can claim it but not the other, is
referred to as FACULTATIVE COMPENSATION.]
(2) Some Problems
(a)

A has a Pl,000,000 savings deposit with the Phil. National
Bank. One day A borrowed P200.000 from the Bank.
Without asking permission from A, the Bank subtracted the
P200.000 from A's account, leaving a balance of P800.000
in A’s favor. Is the bank’s action proper?
ANS.: Yes. Compensation is allowed here because
in this case, the relationship between the bank and the
494

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

id.)
(c)

If deposit with a third person is allowed, the depositary is
liable for the loss if he deposited the thing with a person
who is manifestly careless or unfit. (Ibid.)

The depositary is responsible for the negligence of his
employees. (Ibid.)
(e) The depositary cannot make use of the thing deposited
without the express permission of the depositor. Otherwise,
he shall be liable for damages. However, when the
preservation of the thing requires its use, it must be used
but only for that purpose. (Art. 1977, id.)

(d)

Art. 1288. Neither shall there be compensation if one of
the debts consists in civil liability arising from a penal offense.
496

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1289

COMMENT:
(1) Non-compensation If One Debt Arises from a Crime
Reason for the provision:
“If one of the debts consist in civil liability arising from a
penal offense, compensation would be improper and inadvisable
because the satisfaction of such obligation is imperative." (Report
of the Code Commission, p. 134)
(2) But Victim Can Claim Compensation

It is clear that the criminal cannot claim compensation.
How about the victim?
ANS.: He should be allowed. Justice J.B.L. Reyes says:
“This should be specifically limited to the accused to prevent
his escaping liability by pleading prior credits against the
offended party. But not to the victim of a crime who happens to
be indebted to the accused.” ( Observation on the new Civil Code,
Justice J.B.L. Reyes, Lawyer's Journal, Jan. 31, 1951)
(This is again another instance of FACULTATIVE
COMPENSATION.)

Art. 1289. If a person should have against him several
debts which are susceptible of compensation, the rules on
the application of payments shall apply to the order of the
compensation.

COMMENT:

Note the cross-reference to application of payments.
Steve Tan & Marciano Tan v.
Fabian Mendez, Jr.
GR 138669, June 6, 2002

FACTS: Petitioner Steve Tan and Marciano Tan are
the owners of Master Tours and Travel Corp, and operators
of Philippine Lawin Bus Co., Inc. (PLBCI), while respondent
Fabian Mendez, Jr. is the owner of three gasoline stations
in Iriga City, Ligao in Albay and Sipocot, Camarines Sur.
496

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1289

Petitioners opened a credit line for their buses’ lubricants and
fuel consumption with respondent. At the same time, the latter
was also designated by petitioners as the booking and ticketing
agent of PLBCI in Iriga City.

Under such an arrangement, petitioners’ drivers purchased
on credit fuel and various oil products for its buses through
withdrawal slips issued by petitioners, with periodic payments
to respondent through the issuance of checks. Upon the other
hand, respondent remitted the proceeds of ticket sales to
petitioners also through the issuance of checks. Sent together
with respondent’s remittance are the remittances of the ticket
sales in the Baao Booking Office, which is managed separately
and independently by another agent, Elias Bocsain.
Accordingly, petitioners issued several checks to respondent
as payment for oil and fuel products. One of these is FEBTC
check 704227 dated June 4, 1991 in the amount of P58,237.75
as payment for gasoline and oil products processed during
the period May 2-15, 1991. Said check was dishonored by the
bank upon presentment for payment for being drawn against
insufficient funds. Respondent sent a demand letter dated June
21, 1991 to petitioners demanding that they make good the check
or pay the amount thereof, to no avail. Hence, an information
for violation of BP 22 was filed against petitioners, upon the
complaint of respondent before the RTC of Iriga City, Br. 37.
Petitioners pleaded not guilty during arraignment and
trial ensued. Upon the other hand, the defense presented
petitioner Marciano Tan and Isidro Tan as witnesses. In his
testimony, Marciano averred that he cannot be held liable for
violation of BP 22 because the amount subject of the check had
already been extinguished by offset or compensation against the
collection from ticket sales from the booking offices. He presented
a memorandum dated June 10, 1991 showing the return to
respondent of various uncashed checks in the total amount of
P66,839.25 representing remittance of ticket sales in the Iriga
and Baao offices that were earlier sent by respondent. After the
alleged offset, there remains a balance of P226,785.83.
Upon cross-examination, Marciano admitted to have drawn
the subject check to pay private respondent’s gasoline station
and that it was not covered by sufficient funds at the time of
497

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1289

its issuance due to uncollected receivables. Upon query by the
court, he claimed that he did not talk to private complainant
and could not tell if the latter agreed to offset the checks with
the remittances. Isidro Tan, petitioner’s brother, corroborated
Marciano’s claim of offset. He also admitted speaking with Mulry
Mendez regarding the proposed settlement of the case which,
however, was not accepted by respondent.

On rebuttal, respondent disputed petitioners’ claim of
payment through offset or compensation. He claimed that the
amount of the four unencashed checks totalling P66.839.25
could not have offset the amount of the dishonored checks since
petitioners’ total obligations at that time had already reached
P906.000. Moreover, even if compensation took place, it should
have been applied on an alleged earlier obligation of P235.387.33.
Respondent also claimed that compensation did not take place
as there was no application of payment made by the petitioners
in their memorandum dated June 10, 1991.

After trial, the trial court convicted petitioners for violation
of BP 22. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the
conviction of petitioners, hence, this petition.

ISSUE: Whether the CA erred when it failed to consider
the fact of payment by offsetting prior to the demand letter sent
by respondent despite the abundance of evidence proving the
same.
HELD: It bears stressing that the issue of whether or not
the obligation covered by the subject check had been paid by
compensation or offset is a factual issue that requires evaluation
and assessment of certain facts. This is not proper in a petition
for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court. This Court is
not a trier of facts (Luis Wong v. CA and People, GR 117857,
Feb. 2, 2001; andAleria, Jr. v. Velez, 298 SCRA 611 [1998]), its
jurisdiction over cases elevated from the CA being confined to
the review of errors of law ascribed to the latter, whose findings
offset are conclusive absent any showing that such findings are
entirely devoid of any substantiation on record. On this aspect,
the CA affirmed the findings of the trial court that the alleged
compensation is not supported by clear and positive evidence. For
as found by the trial court, petitioners’ defense of compensation
is unavailing because petitioners did not clearly specify in the
498

Art. 1289

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

memorandum dated June 10, 1991 which dishonored check
is being offset. Applying Art. 1289 read together with Art.
1254 of the Civil Code, the unencashed checks amounting to
P66,839.25 should have been applied to the earlier dishonored
check amounting to P235,387.33 which is more onerous than
the subject check amounting to only P58.237.75.
Moreover, no compensation can take place between
petitioners and respondent as the latter is not a debtor of the
former insofar as the two checks representing collections from
the Baao ticket sales are concerned. The Civil Code requires, as
a prerequisite for compensation, that the parties be mutually
and principally bound as creditors and debtors. (Art. 1278) If
they were not mutually creditors and debtors of each other, the
law on compensation would not apply. (Ibid.) In the case at bar,
the memorandum shows that some unencashed checks returned
to respondent to allegedly offset the dishonored check were
from the Baao ticket sales which are separate from the ticket
sales of respondent. The latter only acted as an intermediary
in remitting the Baao ticket sales and, thus, is not a debtor of
petitioners.

Interestingly, petitioners never alleged compensation
when they received the demand letter, during the preliminary
investigation, or before trial by filing a motion to dismiss. If
indeed there was payment by compensation, petitioners should
have redeemed or taken the checks back in the ordinary course
of business. (Alberto Lim u. People, GR 143231, Oct. 26, 2001,
citing Dico v. CA, 305 SCRA 637 [1999], and Sec. 3[q], Rule 131,
Revised Rules of Court) There is no evidence on record that they
did so.
While the Supreme Court sustained the conviction of
petitioners, it deemed it appropriate to modify the penalties
imposed. It deleted the penalty of imprisonment and in lieu
thereof, imposed upon petitioners a fine amounting to double
the value of the subject check, with subsidiary imprisonment
in case of insolvency or non-payment.
In this instant case, the Court notes that petitioners had
exerted efforts to settle their obligations. The fact of returning
the unencashed checks to respondent indicates good faith on the
part of petitioners. Absent any showing that petitioners acted
499

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1289

in bad faith, the deletion of the penalty of imprisonment in this

case is proper.
The petition is denied and the CA decision is affirmed with
modification. Petitioners are ordered to indemnify respondent
in the amount of P58,237.75 with legal interest from the date of
judicial demand. The sentence of imprisonment of six months is
set aside and in lieu thereof, a fine in the amount of Pl 16,475.50
(P58,237.75 x 2) is imposed upon petitioners, with subsidiary
imprisonment not to exceed six months in case of insolvency or
non-payment. (Rosa Lim v. People., 340 SCRA 497 [2000], citing
Art. 39, par. 2., Rev. Penal Code; Diongzon v. CA, 321 SCRA 477
[1999]; and Llamado v. CA, 270 SCRA 423 [1997])
[NOTE: SC Adm. Cir. 12-2000, as clarified by Adm. Cir.
13-2002, established a rule of preference in imposing penalties in
BP 22 cases. Section 1 of BP 22 imposes the following alternative
penalties for its violation, to wit: (a) imprisonment of not less
than 30 days but not more than one year, or (b) a fine of not less
than but not more than double the amount of the check which
fine shall in no case exceed P200.0OO; or (c) both such fine and
imprisonment at the discretion of the court. The rationale of
Adm. Circular 12-2000 is found in the Supreme Court rulings
in Eduardo Vaca v. CA, 298 SCRA 656 ( 1998); and Rosa Lim v.
People, 340 SCRA 497 (2000). The Court held in those cases that
it would best serve the ends of criminal justice if, in fixing the
penalty to be imposed for violation of BP 22, the same philosophy
underlying the Indeterminate Sentence Law is observed, i.e.,
that of redeeming valuable human material and preventing
unnecessary deprivation of personal liberty and economic
usefulness with due regard to the protection of the social order].
[NOTE: To be sure, it is not its intention, opined the
Supreme Court, to decriminalize violation of BP 22. Neither is it
the intention to delete the alternative penalty of imprisonment.
The propriety and wisdom of decriminalizing violation of BP 22
is best left to the legislature and not this Court. As clarified by
SC Adm. Cir. 13-2001, the clear tenor of Adm. Cir. 12-2000 is
not to remove imprisonment as an alternative penalty, but to
lay down a rule of preference in the application of the penalties
provided for in BP 22. Where the circumstances of the case, for
instance, clearly indicate good faith or a clear mistake of fact
500

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1290

without taint of negligence, the imposition of a fine alone may
be considered as the more appropriate penalty. This rule of
preference does not foreclose the possibility of imprisonment for
violators of BP 22. Neither does it defeat the legislative intent
behind the law. Needless to say the determination of whether the
circumstances warrant the imposition of a fine alone rests solely
upon the judge. Should the judge decide that imprisonment is
the more appropriate penalty, Adm. Cir. 12-2000 ought not to
be deemed a hindrance. (Adm. Cir. 13-2001, cited in Alberto Lim
v. People, supra)]
[NOTE further: The Supreme Court is not unaware
of the importance of checks in commercial transactions. In
commercial parlance, they have been widely and fittingly known
as the substitute of money and have effectively facilitated the
smooth flow of commercial transactions. The pernicious effects
and repercussions of circulating worthless checks are simply
unimaginable. It is for this reason that BP 22 was enacted by the
legislature, to penalize individuals who would place worthless
checks in circulation and degrade the value and importance of
checks in commercial transactions. Nevertheless, while this
Court recognizes the noble objective of BP 22 it deems it proper
to apply the philosophy underlying the Indeterminate Sentence
Law in imposing penalties for its violation. The gist of Adm.
Cir. 13-2000 is to consider the underlying circumstances of the
case such that if the situation calls for the imposition of the
alternative penalty of fine rather than imprisonment, the courts
should not hesitate to do so. (Steve Tan and Marciano Tan v.
Fabian Mendez, Jr., supra)]

Art. 1290. When all the requisites mentioned in Article
1279 are present, compensation takes effect by operation of
law, and extinguishes both debts to the concurrent amount,
even though the creditors and debtors are not aware of the
compensation.

COMMENT:
Automatic Compensation If All Requisites Are Present
(a) Note that legal compensation takes place automatically
unless there has been valid waiver thereof.
501

Art. 1290

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

Compensation which extinguishes principal obligations
also extinguishes accessory obligations. (Manresa)
“To the concurrent amount” means that if one debt is larger
than the other, the balance subsists as debt.

Court of Appeals. Said court dismissed the petition, saying
that the circumstances of this case prevent legal compensation
from taking place because the question of whether Natividad is
indebted to ICB in the amount of P6.81 million representing the
deficiency balance after the foreclosure of mortgage is disputed.

International Corporate Bank, Inc. v. IAC, et al.
GR 69560, June 30, 1988

bar?

(c)

FACTS: In 1980, Natividad secured from International
Corporate Bank’s (ICB’s) predecessor-in-interest a loan of P50
million. To secure this loan, Natividad mortgaged her real

properties in Manila and Bulacan. Of this Ioan, only P20 million
was approved for release. The same amount was applied to pay
other obligations to ICB. Thus, Natividad claims that she did
not receive anything from the approved loan. Later, Natividad
made a money market placement with ICB’s predecessor in the
amount of Pl million at 17% interest per annum for a period
of 32 days. Meanwhile, Natividad allegedly failed to pay her
mortgage indebtedness to ICB so that the latter refused to pay
the proceeds of the money market placement on maturity but
applied the amount instead to the deficiency in the proceeds
of the auction sale of the mortgaged properties. With ICB’s
predecessor being the only bidder, said properties were sold in
its favor for only P20 million. ICB claims that after deducting
this amount Natividad is still indebted in the amount of
P6 million.
In 1982, Natividad sued ICB for annulment of the sheriff’s
sale of the mortgaged properties, for the release to her of the
balance of her loan from ICB in the amount of P30 million
and for recovery of Pl million representing the proceeds of her
money market investment. She alleges that the mortgage is
not yet due and demandable and, hence, the foreclosure was
illegal. ICB answered, saying that it has the right to apply or
set off Natividad’s money market claim of Pl million. ICB thus
interposes counterclaims to recover P5.7 million representing
the balance of its deficiency claim after deducting the proceeds
of the money market placement.
The trial judge ordered ICB to deliver to Natividad the
amount of Pl.06 million conditioned upon Natividad’s filing
a bond. ICB filed a special civil action for certiorari with the
502

Art. 1291

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ISSUE: Can there be legal compensation in the case at

HELD: No. Undoubtedly, ICB is indebted to Natividad
in the amount of Pl.06 million, representing the proceeds
of her money market investment. But whether Natividad is
indebted to ICB in the amount of P6.8 million representing
the deficiency balance after the foreclosure of the mortgage
executed to secure the loan is disputed. This circumstance
prevents legal compensation from taking place. The validity of
the extrajudicial foreclosure sale and ICB’s claim for deficiency
are still in question, so much so that the requirement of Art.
1279 that the debts must be liquidated and demandable has
not yet been met. Hence, legal compensation cannot take place
under Art. 1290 of the Civil Code.
[NOTA BENE: With the presence of all the requisites
mentioned in Art. 1270 of the Code, legal compensation takes
effect by operation of law as provided in Art. 1290 thereof.

Section 6

NOVATION
Art. 1291. Obligations may be modified by:
(1) Changing their object or principal conditions;
(2) Substituting the person of the debtor;
(3) Subrogating a third person in the right of the

creditor.
COMMENT:
(1) ‘Novation’ Defined

“By novation is understood the substitution or change of an
obligation by another, which extinguishes or modifies the first,
503

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1291

either changing its object or principal condition, or substituting
another in place of the debtor, or subrogating a third person in
the right of the creditor.” (8 Manresa 428)

(4) Kinds of Novation
(a)

The term “principal conditions" in Art. 1291 of the New
Civil Code should be construed to include a change in the
period to comply with the obligation, which change in the period
would only be partial novation, since the period merely affects
the performance, not the creation of the obligation. (Ong v.
Bognalbal, 501 SCRA 490 [2006])

According to Its Object or Purpose
1)

2)

Novation

“Between the civil and common law, with reference to the
extinguishment of one obligation by the creation of another, there
seems to be no difference. Under both systems of jurisprudence,
in order to extinguish one obligation by the creation of another,
the extinguishment must be made to clearly appear.” ( Tiu Suico
v. Havana, 45 Phil. 707)

(3) Dual Purpose or Function of Novation

“As could be seen, unlike other modes of extinction of
obligations, novation is a juridical act of dual function in that
at the time it extinguishes an obligation, it creates a new one in
lieu of the old.” (Gov’t, of the P.I. v. Bautista, [CA] 37 O.G. No.
97, p. 1880)
[NOTE: While a true or proper novation extinguishes an
obligation, a partial, modificatory or imperfect novation merely
modifies the old obligation. Thus, Art. 1291 says “Obligations
may be MODIFIED by . . .” (See TS, Feb. 10, 1950) Moreover,
since a new or modified obligation arises, novation “does not
operate as an absolute but only as a relative extinction." (8

Manresa 428)]
504

—

(changing the object or the
Real or Objective
principal conditions of the obligation). (Art. 1291, par.
1)

(2) No Difference in Civil and Common Law Concepts of

“A novation, under the rules of the Civil Law, whence the
term has been introduced into the modern nomenclature of our
common law jurisprudence, was a mode of extinguishing one
obligation by another; the substitution, not of a new paper or
note, but of a new obligation, in lieu of an old one, the effect of
which was to pay, dissolve, or otherwise discharge it.” (Words
and Phrases, Vol. 5, p. 4848)

Iloilo Traders Finance, Inc. v. Heirs
of Oscar Soriano, Jr., et al.
GR 149683, June 16, 2003

FACTS: The parties to a case for the collection
of a loan increased the indebtedness due to accruing
interest, from P290.691 to P431.200. The compromise
agreement extended the period of payment and
provided for new terms of payment, and provided for
a waiver of claims, counterclaims, attorney’s fees,
or damages that the debtors might have against
their creditors. However, the settlement neither
cancelled, nor materially altered the usual clauses
in the real estate mortgages, e.g., the foreclosure of
the mortgaged property in case of default.
505

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1291

ISSUE: Could it be said that the original
obligation of the debtors had been impliedly modified?
HELD: Yes. Novation is merely modificatory
where the change brought about by any subsequent

(5) Requisites for Novation (in General)
(a)

agreement is merely incidental to the main obligation
(eg., a change of interest rates) (Bank of Philippines
Islands v. Abaladejo, 53 Phil. 14) or an extension of
time to pay. (Kabankalan Sugar Co. v. Pacheco, 55

Phil. 555)
Novation of a contract may either be extinctive
or modificatory, much being dependent on the nature
of the change and the intention of the parties.
Extinctive novation is never presumed; there
must be an express intention to novate. In cases
where it is implied, the acts of the parties must clearly
demonstrate their intent to dissolve the old obligation
as the moving consideration for the emergence of the
new one. Implied novation necessitates that the old
obligation is completely superseded by the new one.

(b)

(c)

If the old obligation is VOID or NON¬
EXISTENT, there is nothing to novate.
(Madamba Vda. de Adiarte v. Tumaneng,
88 Phil. 333)

2)

If the old obligation is VOIDABLE, novation
is still possible provided the obligation has
not yet been annulled. (Art. 1298, Civil

The intent to extinguish or to modify the old obligation by a
substantial difference (the extinguishment or modification
itself is a RESULT of novation).
The capacity and consent of all the parties (except in
the case of expromision, where the old debtor does not
participate).

The consent of the creditor to the change of debtors,
whether in expromision or delegation, is an indispensable
requirement. Substitution of one debtor for another may
delay or prevent the fulfillment of the obligation by reason
of the inability or insolvency of the new debtor. Hence, the

creditor should agree to accept the substitution in order
that it may be binding on him.
Example: In a contract where X is the creditor and Y
is the debtor, if Y enters into a contract with Z under which
he transfers to Z all his rights under the first contract,
together with the obligations thereunder, but such transfer
is not consented to or approved by X, there is no novation.
X can still bring his action against Y for the performance
of their contract or damages in case of breach.

(this is also termed
partial or modificatory
imperfect or improper novation)

[Here the old obligation is merely modified; thus,
it still remains in force except insofar as it has been
modified. Should there be any doubt as to whether
the novation is total or partial, it shall be presumed
to be merely modificatory. (TS, Dec. 30, 1935)]

The existence of a VALID old obligation.

Code)]

The test of incompatibility is whether they can
stand together, each one having an independent
existence, if they cannot and are irreconcilable, the
subsequent obligation would also extinguish the first.
An extinctive novation would, thus, have the twin
effects of, first, extinguishing an existing obligation
and, second, creating a new one in its stead. This kind
of novation presupposes a confluence of four essential
requisites: (1) a previous valid obligation, (2) an
agreement of all parties concerned to a new contract,
(3) the extinguishments of the old obligation, and
(4) the birth of a valid new obligation.
2)

[NOTE: If the new obligation is subject to a suspensive
condition, such as the obtaining of some signatures, and
507

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1291

the condition does not materialize, such new obligation
never became valid or effective, so no novation has resulted.
(Martinez v. Cavives, 25 Phil. 581) If the contemplated new
obligation is embodied in a mere draft, which is unsigned
and therefore not consented to, no new obligation is created
because of the absence of novation. (Vaca v. Kosca, 26 Phil.
388)]

Torres, et al. v. Court of Appeals
GR 92540, Dec. 11, 1992
Raising for the first time the issue of novation only

(6) Novation Is Not One of the Means Recognized by the

Revised Penal Code Whereby Criminal Liability Can Be
Extinguished

Art. 1292

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Cruz v. Gangan
443 Phil. 856 (2003)

FACTS: Dr. Filonila 0. Cruz Camanaya District Director of
TESDA, boarded the LRT from Sen. Puyat Ave. to Monumento
when her handbag was slashed and the contents were stolen
by an unidentified person. Among those stolen were her wallet
and the government-issued cellular phone. She thus reported
the incident to the police authorities. However, the thief was
not located, and the cellphone was not recovered. She also
reported the loss to the Regional Director of TESDA, and she
requested that she be freed from accountability for the cellphone.
The Resident Auditor of the COA denied her request on the
ground that she lacked the diligence required in the custody
of government property and was ordered to pay the purchase
value in the total amount of P4,238. The COA found no sufficient
justification to grant the request for relief from accountability.

Novation, a civil law concept relating to the modification
ofobligationsfSee Arts. 1291-1304, Sec. 6, Chap. 4, Title I, Book
IV of the new Civil Code), is not one of the means recognized
by the Revised Penal Code whereby criminal liability can be
extinguished; hence, the role of novation may only be to either
prevent the rise of criminal liability or to cast doubt on the true
nature of the original basic transportation, whether or not it was
such that its breach would not give rise to penal responsibility,
as when money loaned is made to appear as a deposit, or other
similar disguise is resorted to. (People v. Nery, L-19567, Feb.
5, 1964) For that matter, novation has been invoked to reverse
convictions in cases where an underlying contract initially
defined the relation of the parties.

ISSUE: Is the COA’s findings correct?
HELD: The Supreme Court reversed the ruling and found
that riding the LRT cannot per se be denounced as a negligent
act more so because Cruz’s mode of transit was influenced by
time and money consideration; that she boarded the LRT to
be able to arrive in Caloocan in time for 3 p.m. meeting, that
any prudent and rational person under similar circumstances
can reasonably be expected to do the same; that possession of a
cellphone should not hinder one from boarding the LRT coach
as Cruz did considering that whether she rode a jeep or bus,
the risk of theft would have also been present; that because
of her relatively low position and pay, she was not expected to
have her own vehicle or to ride a taxicab; she did not have a
government-assigned vehicle; that placing the cellphone in bag
away as she did is ordinarily sufficient care of a cellphone while
travelling on board the LRT; and that the records did not show
any specific act of negligence on her part and negligence can
never be presumed.

Note that the case of Cruz v. Gangan, 443 Phil. 856, cited
by petitioners in their pleadings, where the victims of robbery
were exonerated from liability, find no application to the instant
case.

Art. 1292. In order that an obligation may be extinguished
by another which substitutes the same, it is imperative that
it be so declared in unequivocal terms, or that the old and
the new obligation be on every point incompatible with each

COMMENT:

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(3) Cases

(1) Express and Implied Novation

According to the manner or form in which the novation has
been constituted or made, novation is classified into:
(a)

express novation, it is declared in unequivocal terms. (Art.
1292)

(b)

National Exchange Co., Ltd. v. Ramos
51 Phil. 310

FACTS: A corporation was being established. A subscribed
to some shares of stock in the proposed corporation. Without A’s
consent, the authorized capital of the corporation was increased.
ISSUE: Is A relieved of his obligation to pay for said shares?
HELD: Yes. “One who subscribes for stock of a proposed

implied novation (complete or substantial incompatibility).
(Borja v. Mariano, 38 O.G. 2576; see Guerrero v. Court of

Appeals, L-21676, Feb. 28, 1969)
(2) How Implied Novation May Be Made

Implied novation is done by making SUBSTANTIAL

CHANGES (a)
(b)

in the object or subject matter of the contract (Example:
delivery of a car instead of a diamond ring)
in the cause or consideration of the contract [Example: an
upward change in the price. (Matute v. Hernandez, 6 Phil.
68)]

in the principal terms or conditions of the contract
(Examples:
1)

if a debt subject to a condition is made an absolute
one without a condition. (Macondray v. Ruiz, 66 Phil.
562)

2)

reduction of the term or period originally stipulated.
(Kabankalan Sugar Co. v. Pacheco, 55 Phil. 555)

3)

corporation is relieved of his obligation, if, without his consent,
the authorized capital stock of the corporation is increased.”

Rios, et al. v. Jacinto, Palma y Honos
49 Phil. 7
FACTS: A rented a house from B. In the contract of lease,
the lessee A was given authority to assign the lease to strangers.
Because of this A leased it to C.
B?

capital stock of a corporation is increased. Here the

subscribers who did not consent to the increase are
released or freed from their subscription. (National
Exchange Co. v. Ramos, 51 Phil. 310)]
(NOTE: Novation through change of the
object, cause, or principal terms and conditions is
not presumed; clear proof of novation must be given.
(Martinez v. Cavives, 25 Phil. 591)]
610

ISSUE: Is A released from his obligation towards the lessor

HELD: “A provision in a lease under which the lessee is
authorized to assign it to strangers to the contract does not, in
the event of such assignment, release the original lessee from
his obligations to the lessor, unless it be specifically agreed that
the assignment shall have that effect.”
Petterson v. Azada
8 Phil. 432
FACTS: A owed C P500 and P3.000 evidenced by two
promissory notes. Later, a new loan of P300 was obtained. By
express agreement, the three debts were consolidated into one
promissory note for P3,800 (P500 plus P3,000 plus P300). That
the last promissory note was to take the place of the others was
agreed upon.

ISSUE: Is there novation here?

HELD: Yes, in view of the changes made.
[NOTE: Had there been no proof that the third note
intended to replace the others, there really would be nothing

inconsistent with having different notes for different amount If
there is no novation, all the obligations would remain subsisting
and the debtor would be liable for all.]

GR 56450, July 25, 1983
If a mortgage agreement is replaced by a surety bond, the
mortgagee’s right would be abridged. A mortgage lien is a right

surety is only a right in personam.

the fiscal, there would be no criminal liability for estafa.

by reducing the amount stated in the judgment,
and by
stipulating an attorney’s fees in case of non-payment,
and by inserting a penalty clause, the judgment may be
considered to have been novated. (Fua Cam Lu v. Yap
Fauco, 74 Phil. 287)]
(f)

When a guarantor enters into an agreement with the
creditor that he (the guarantor) will also be a principal
debtor. (Here the original principal debtor is not released
from his obligation). (Santos v. Reyes, 10 Phil. 123)
(g) When the creditor in the meantime refrains from (or
forbears from) suing the debtor (Teal Motors v. Continental
Ins. Co., 59 Phil. 814), or even when the creditor merely
extends the term of payment, for here the period merely
affects the performance, not the creation of the obligation.
(Inchausti v. Yulo, 32 Phil. 978; and Zapanta v. De
Rotaeche, 21 Phil. 154)

(4) Instances When the Court Held That There Was NO

Extinctive Novation
(Here the original contract or obligation remains, subject
only to the slight modifications introduced. In other words, only
a modificatory novation has been effected.)
(a)

(b)

When there are only slight alterations or modifications in
the construction plans of a building. (Tiu Suico v. Habana,
45 Phil. 707)
When the new contract merely contains supplementary
agreement. (Asiatic Petroleum Co. v. Quary Sim Pao, [CAJ
40 O.G. Supp. Nov. 1, 1941, p. 44)

(c)

When additional interest is agreed upon. (Bank of the PJ.
v. Gooch, 45 Phil. 514)

(d)

When additional security is given. (Bank of the P.l. v.
Herridge, 47 Phil. 57)

(e)

When, after a final judgment, a contract was entered into
precisely to provide a method of payment other than that
stated in the judgment. (Zapanta v. Rotaeche, 21 Phil. 154)
[NOTE: But the Supreme Court has held that if
the object of the new contract is to settle the judgment,

Art. 1292

of any extinctive modification. (See Art. 2079, Civil Code)]

(h)

When the place of payment is changed or when there is a
variation in the amount of partial payments. (8 Manresa

429)

(i)

When a public instrument is executed to confirm a valid
contract, whether oral or in a private instrument. (Ibid.)

(j)

When payment of the purchase price for certain trucks is
made by the execution of a promissory note for said price.
Here, there is no novation of the contract of sale. (Luneta
Motor Co. v. Baguio Bus Co., L-15157, June 30, 1960)

(5) Cases

Tiu Suico v. Habana
45 Phil. 707
FACTS: A engaged B to construct a building for him (AJ. In
the process of the construction, many written alterations were
agreed upon and really made, but it was proved that essentially,
the plans followed were the original plans. It must be stated
513

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1292

that in the contract, a specific amount for the construction
was agreed upon. Later, when the building was finished, the
contractor wanted to abandon the original price on the ground
that the alterations in the building had caused an abandonment
or a novation of the old contract. The contractor therefor wanted
to be paid, not on the basis of the contract, but on the basis of
quantum meruit. The owner did not consent to this.

ISSUE: Was there novation here?
HELD: There was no novation here. The old contract was
not abandoned since, after all, the original plans were followed.
Therefore, without the consent of the owner, the contractor
cannot treat the old contract as abandoned. The contractor,
without the consent of the owner, cannot recover on the basis of
quantum meruit (on the work done). Rather, the contract price
will form the basis for payment, plus the cost of the alterations.
[NOTE: Under Art. 1724 of the New Civil Code, the
contractor cannot demand an increase in the price unless
the change in the plans and specifications was authorized in
writing and the additional price to be paid was also determined
in writing by both parties. Under the old Civil Code, no such
requisite in writing was essential.]

Asiatic Petroleum Co. v. Quay Sim Pao
(CA) 40 O.G. Supp. Nov. 1, 1941, p. 44
FACTS: A, in a contract of agency with B, agreed to be the
agent of the latter. In the course of the agency, the agent was
given certain privileges and facilities, which, however, were not
incompatible with the old agreement.
ISSUE: Was there novation here?
HELD: There was no novation here because there is real
incompatibility between the old and the new agreements.
Besides, the new agreement was merely of a supplemental
nature.
Zapanta v. Rotaeche
21 Phil. 154

FACTS: In a final judgment, Zapanta was declared the
debtor of Ortiz. Later, Zapanta and Ortiz agreed that the
514

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1292

judgment was to be extinguished by payment in
monthly
installments, with the stipulation that in case of default,
Ortiz
could sue Zapanta. Zapanta later defaulted. Ortiz,
protect
to
his rights, obtained an execution of the final judgment
referred
to, and so the property of Zapanta was levied upon.
Zapanta
now instituted this action for damages on the ground that the
execution was improper, the judgment having been extinguished
by novation.

HELD: The contract did not expressly extinguish the
obligations existing in said judgment. On the contrary, it
expressly recognizes the obligations existing between the parties
in said judgment, and expressly provides a method by which the
same shall be extinguished. The contract, instead of containing
provisions absolutely incompatible with the obligations of the
judgment, expressly ratifies such obligations and contains
provisions for satisfying them. The said agreement simply gave
Zapanta a method and more time for the satisfaction of the
judgment. It did not extinguish the obligations contained in the
judgment until the terms of said contract had been fully complied
with. Had Zapanta continued to comply with the conditions of
the contract, he might have successfully invoked its provisions
against the issuance of an execution upon the said judgment.
The contract and the punctual compliance with its terms only
delayed the right of the defendant to an execution upon the
judgment. There was therefore no novation, and execution was
proper.

Fua Cam Lu v. Yap Fauco
74 Phil. 287

FACTS: A debtor was, by final judgment, ordered to pay
Pl,500, with legal interest and costs. Later, the debtor executed
a mortgage in favor of the judgment creditor containing the

following terms:
1)

2)
3)

The debt was reduced to Pl,200, payable in four monthly
installments of P300 each.
The debtor’s camarin was mortgaged to the creditor.
In case of failure to pay any of the installments, the debtor
would pay for attorney’s fees and judicial costs in the
action to be brought by the creditor.

—

515

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1292

The difference of P300 would have to be given to the
creditor.
5) The agreement was entered into as a settlement of the
judgment.
ISSUE: Was there extinctive novation?
HELD: There was extinctive novation, in view of the
incompatibility between the judgment and the contract,
considering the fact that the judgment was payable at once, was
unsecured, and contained a stipulation for attorney’s fees. The
contract was NOT a mere extension of the period within which
to pay the judgment because the contract itself stated that the
promise to pay the Pl,200 was precisely made as a settlement
of said judgment. There would have been no settlement had it
not been implicitly agreed that the obligation in the judgment
was considered by both parties as already extinguished.
4)

Inchausti and Co. v. Yulo
34 Phil. 978

FACTS: Four people were solidarity bound in a contract
made on Aug. 12, 1909. On May 12, 1911, three of them made
a contract with the creditor giving the three debtors different
terms and conditions for the payment of the obligation. Said
new contract reaffirmed the liability of the debtor not present.
When the absent debtor, Gregorio Yulo, was asked to pay, he
presented the defense of novation to the effect that the second
contract is incompatible with the first, and that, therefore, he
should not be made to pay.
ISSUE: Is Gregorio Yulo correct?
HELD: No, Gregorio Yulo is wrong. Far from providing that
the obligation of four was being substituted by the obligation
of three, the new contract ratified or reaffirmed the obligation
of the absent debtor, and therefore the absent debtor, Gregorio
Yulo, must pay. Said the Supreme Court:
“With respect to the third, there can also be no doubt that
the contract of May 12, 1911, does not constitute a novation of
the former one of Aug. 12, 1909, with respect to the other debtors

who execute this contract, or more concretely, with respect to
the defendant Gregorio Yulo: First, because in order that an
516

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1292

obligation may be extinguished by another which
substitutes it, it
is necessary that it should be so expressly declared or that
the old
and the new be incompatible in all points,” and the instrument
of May 12, 1911, far from expressly declaring that the obligation
of the three who executed it substitutes the former signed by
Gregorio Yulo and the other debtors, expressly and clearly
stated that the obligation of Gregorio Yulo to pay the 253,000
and odd pesos sued for exists, stipulating that the suit must
continue its course, and if necessary, these three parties who
executed the contract on May 12, 1911, would cooperate in order
that the action against Gregorio Yulo might prosper (7th point
in the statement of facts), with other undertakings concerning
the execution of the judgment which might be rendered against
Gregorio Yulo in this same suit. “It is always necessary to state
that it is the intention of the contracting parties to extinguish
the former obligation by the new one. (Judgment in cassation,
July 8, 1909) There exists no incompatibility between the old
and the new obligation as will be demonstrated in the resolution
of the last point, and for the present we will merely reiterate
the legal doctrine that an obligation to pay a sum of money is
not novated in a new instrument wherein the old is ratified, by
changing only the term of payment and adding other obligations
not incompatible with the old one.” (Judgments in cassation of
June 28, 1904 and of July 8, 1909)

People v. Nery
L-19567, Feb. 5, 1964

FACTS: Soledad Nery was given by Federia Mantillaro two
diamond rings to be sold by her. If successful, Nery was supposed
to receive a commission. She failed to return the rings or their
cash value, so the owner sued her for estafa. While the case was
pending, she executed a deed of compromise, promising to pay
for the money in installments. After making one payment, she
did not continue paying for the balance. She now contends that
she ought to be acquitted because the acceptance by the owner
of the partial payment NOVATED the original relation between
the parties.

HELD: She is still guilty of estafa, firstly, because the
exaction of criminal responsibility is something that can be
renounced only by the State, not by the offended party; and
617

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1292

secondly, because there was no intent to extinguish the original
relationship. The novation theory may perhaps apply PRIOR
to the filing of the criminal information in court because up
to that time, the original trust relation may be converted by
the parties into an ordinary creditor-debtor situation, thereby
placing the victim in estoppel should he insist on the original
trust. But AFTER the filing of the case in court, the offended
party may no longer divest the prosecution of its power to exact
the criminal liability as distinguished from the civil. The crime
being an offense against the State, only the latter may renounce
the criminal consequences. The acceptance of partial satisfaction
cannot indeed effect the nullification of a criminal liability that
is already fully mature and in the process of judgment. (U.S. v.
Montanes, 8 Phil. 620; Abeto v. People, 90 Phil. 581; and Camus
v. Court of Appeals, 48 O.G. No. 3898)

Carlos B. Gonzales v. Eulogio Serrano
L-25791, Sept. 23, 1968
FACTS: By virtue of an agreement which was on the
surface one of C.O.D. (Cash on Delivery), but which was really
an agency to sell, Carlos B. Gonzales delivered to one Librada
S. Asis certain flowers worth approximately PIO,000. When the
woman took delivery of the flowers, she paid P2,000 cash and
issued a check for P8.000. The next day, she requested Gonzales
not to deposit the check for she did not have sufficient funds in
the bank as she had not yet been able to dispose of the flowers.
Gonzales agreed by not depositing the check. Nearly a month
later, she made a partial payment of P5,500 on the balance.
Regarding the remaining debt, she offered to return the unsold
flowers corresponding to the amount of the deficiency. Gonzales
then sued her for estafa.
ISSUE: Is she guilty of estafa?
HELD: She is not guilty of estafa, in view of the following
reasons:
(a) The agreement, although apparently one of C.O.D., was
actually an agency to sell; she could return the unsold
goods instead of the price therefor. Here, she is willing to
return; and even if she does not, there would only be a civil
obligation, not a criminal offense.
518

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(b)

Art. 1292

Even granting that a trust relation had been created
because of the C.O.D. and the issuance of the check, still
there would be no liability for a crime because the parties,
a short time after the delivery of the check, changed the
original trust relation into an ordinary creditor-debtor
situation. Hence, the novation of the contract took place
long before the filing of the criminal complaint.

La Campana Food Products, Inc. v. PCIB, et al.
GR 46405, June 30, 1986
Where the mortgagee-bank agreed to guarantee
the mortgagor’s foreign loan subject to the condition that
the latter should deposit with the former the proceeds of
the loan which should be made available for payment to
the mortgagor’s obligation to a local financial institution
and to serve as working capital, the mortgagee-bank did
not substitute the mortgagor as debtor to the financial
institution.

The mortgagee-bank's guarantee has to be secured by
the first mortgage on the assets then mortgaged to the said
bank and the assets offered as additional securities, which
included the parcels of land mortgaged to the financial
institution. Hence, the mortgagee-bank requires the
financial institution to lend the transfer certificates of title
covering the parcels of land mortgaged by the mortgagor
to the financial institution for the mortgagee-bank to be
able to register its mortgage therein.
Bisaya Land Transportation Co., Inc. v. Sanchez
GR 74623, Aug. 31, 1987
FACTS: A, the receiver of BISTRANCO, and S entered
into a shipping agency contract whereby S was constituted
as shipping agent and was to receive 10% commission on
all freight and passenger revenues coming from Butuan
City and 5% for all freight going to Butuan. Thereafter, a
memorandum of agreement was entered into whereby the
rate of commission for freight and passage was reduced
from 10% to 7-1/2% and the term of the contract reduced
from five years to a term of one year renewable yearly upon

mutual consent.
519

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1292

Later, BISTRANCO contacted the shippers advising
them to transact their business directly with its new
branch office. S sued BISTRANCO for specific performance.
BISTRANCO answered that the working agreements
executed by S and BISTRANCO novated the agency
contract.
HELD: The memorandum of agreement was not
meant to novate the contract. The intent of the parties
was to suspend some of the provisions of the contracts for
a period of one year, during which the provisions of the
Agreement will prevail. Thus, the agreement that: “It is
in this spirit of cooperation with A to enable him to pay
huge obligations of the company that agent S has acceded
to the request of BISTRANCO to accept the reduction of
his commissions."
It would not be equitable for S to say that the
contracts were extinguished and substituted by the
Agreement. It would punish S for concessions he extended
to BISTRANCO.
The changes were not really substantial to bring
about novation. The changes between the contract and the
agreement did not go into the essence of the cause or object
of the agreement. Under the agreement, S remains the
agent of BISTRANCO. There is no clear incompatibility.
The contract and the agreement can be reconciled. The
provisions of the agreement which were more of changes
on how to enforce the agency prevailed during the period
provided in them, but after their expiration, the conditions
under the contracts were implemented again.

can still enforce the obligation against the debtor.
(6) Novation Is Never Presumed

Ace Foods, Inc. v. Micro Pacific Technologies Co., Ltd.
712 SCRA 679
As a mode of extinguishing an obligation, an obligation is
never presumed and the animus novandi, whether totally or
partially, must appear by express agreement of the parties, or
by these acts that are too clear and unequivocal to be mistaken.

Art. 1293. Novation which consists in substituting a new

debtor in the place of the original one, may be made even
without the knowledge or against the will of the latter, but
not without the consent of the creditor. Payment by the new
debtor gives him the rights mentioned in Articles 1236 and
1237.

COMMENT:
(1) Personal or Subjective Novation

There are two kinds of personal or subjective novation:
(a) change of the debtor (passive)
(b) change of the creditor (active)

De Cortes v. Venturanza
79 SCRA 709
A substitution of debtor without the consent of the
creditor is binding upon the parties to the substitution but
not on the creditor.

Reyes v. Court of Appeals
76 SCAD 29
(1996)

(2) Substitution of Debtor

The mere circumstance of the creditor receiving
payments from a third party who acquiesced to assume the

obligation of the debtor when there is clearly no agreement
to release the debtor from the responsibility does not
constitute novation.
At most, it only creates a juridical relation of co¬
debtorship or suretyship on the part of the third party to

Art. 1293

Article 1293 speaks of passive subjective novation

(substitution of the debtor), which may be in the form of:

expromision (where the initiative comes from a third
person). (Art. 1294, Civil Code)
(b) delegation (where the initiative comes from the debtor, for
it is he who delegates another to pay the debt, and thus, he

(3) Expromision

Ait. 1293

the new debtor’s insolvency or non-fulfillment of the
obligation shall not give rise to any liability on the part of
the original debtor.”)
(4) Requisites for Expromision

(a)

Here the initiative comes from a third person.

(a)

(b)

It is essential that the old debtor be RELEASED from
his obligation, otherwise there will be no expromision, no
novation.

The initiative must come from a third person (who will be
the new debtor).

(b)

The new debtor and the creditor must CONSENT. (Garcia
v. Khu Yek Chiong, 38 O.G. No. 926)

Example:

(c)

The old debtor must be excused or released from his
obligation.

D owes C Pl,000,000. F, a friend of D, approaches C
and tells him: “I will pay you whatD owes you." C agrees.
Is there expromision here?

(NOTE: The old debtor’s consent or knowledge is not
required. (Art. 1293, Civil Code)]

[NOTE: The mere written statement of a widow that
she hoped to pay part of her husband’s bank debt does not
result in expromision. (Garcia v. De Manzano, 39 Phil. 577)]

ANS.: Under the facts given, there is no expromision
because they did not agree that D would be released from
his obligation. If F therefore does not pay C, C will still be
allowed to collect from D. It is evident here that no novation
exists because it may be that C understood F to be acting
merely as the agent of D, although F may not have done
so as such agent. (See 8 Manresa 435) Thus, it has been
ruled that if a creditor accepts partial payments from a
third person who has decided to assume the obligation,
BUT there is no agreement that the first debtor shall be
released from responsibility, no novation has yet taken
place, and the creditor can still enforce the obligation
against the original debtor. (See Magdalena Estates, Inc.
v. Rodriguez, L-18411, Dec. 17, 1966)
Example of True Expromision:

D owes C Pl,000,000. F, friend of D, approaches C
and tells him: “I will pay you what D owes you. From now
on, consider me your debtor, not D. D is to be excused. Do
you agree?” C agrees. Is there expromision here?
ANS.: Yes, and even if F does not pay C, D cannot be
held liable anymore because his obligation has already been
extinguished. (Art. 1294 provides that: “If the substitution
is without the knowledge or against the will of the debtor,

Gil Villanueva v. Filomeno Girged
L-15154, Dec. 29, 1960

FACTS: Girged owed Villanueva a certain sum of money.
Legaspi wrote Villanueva a letter stating that he (Legaspi) would
be “the one to take care” of Girged’s debt “as soon as” Girged
has made a shipment of logs to Japan. Girged never made such
shipment. Legaspi did NOT pay Villanueva.
ISSUE: Is Legaspi liable to Villanueva?

,

HELD: No. First, because Legaspi did NOT assume
Girged’s debt. He merely assured that the debt would be taken
cared of. Secondly, even granting that there was an assumption
of indebtedness, still the condition the shipment has NOT
yet been fulfilled. Thus, Legaspi cannot be held liable.

(5) Delegacion

(a)

'

'

This is defined as a method of novation caused by the
replacement of the old debtor by a new debtor, who (the
old debtor) has proposed him to the creditor, and which
replacement has been agreed to by said creditor and by
said new debtor.
623

Art. 1293

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

Note that here the delegation or initiative comes from the
old debtor himself.

released from the obligation; otherwise, there is no valid

delegation.

(a)

The delegante

Example:

(b)

If a debtor phones his creditor and tells him that F, a
friend, will pay the debt, and the creditor agrees, this does
not necessarily mean that a delegation has been effected,
for after all, the friend may be acting only as an agent,
messenger, or employee of the debtor. Upon the other hand,
if the debtor tells the creditor, “My friend F will pay my
debt. I, therefore, wish to be released from my obligation,"
and both the friend and the creditor agree, this would be
a correct example of delegation. In such a case, if F fails to
pay, will the old debtor be excused?

(c)

The delegatario the creditor
The delegado the new debtor

ANS.: Generally yes, in view of the novation, except if
Fs failure to pay was due to insolvency, and such insolvency
was already existing and of public knowledge OR already
existing and known to the debtor when he delegated his
debt. (Art. 1295) The reason for the exception is evident:
his obvious bad faith. (See 8 Manresa 437)
C.N. Hodges v. Matias C. Rey
L-12554, Feb. 28, 1961
FACTS: Rey borrowed from Hodges the sum of
P3.000. Three days after the loan was contracted, Rey by
means of a letter, authorized the Phil. Nat. Bank to pay his
indebtedness to Hodges out of whatever crop loan might
be granted to him by said bank. On the same date, the
Bank agreed. But the Bank paid Hodges only P2.000. On
the date of maturity, Hodges sued the Bank and Rey for
the remaining Pl,000.

ISSUE: Is the Bank liable to Rey?

HELD: No, for the Bank did NOT assume Rey’s
indebtedness. The fact that it paid P2,000 does not bind

the Bank for the remainder of Pl,000, for what it did was

All the parties concerned must consent or agree. (Garcia

Appeals, et al., 92 Phil. 758)
[NOTE: The consent of the creditor:

Coleman, [CA] 39 O.G., p. 986, March 29, 1941);

2)

Banking Corporation v. Elser, 54 Phil. 994; and
Barretto y Cia v. Alba & Sevilla, 62 Phil. 593) but
not from his mere acceptance of payment by a third
party, for there is no true transfer of the debt here

may be before or after the new debtor has given his
consent (TS, June 16, 1908 and Estate of Mota v.

fulfilled; otherwise, there is no valid delegacion.
(Gov’t, v. Bautista, [CA] 7 O.G. [47] 1880)]

(8) Rights of the New Debtor

The law says that “payment by the new debtor gives
him the rights mentioned in Arts. 1236 and 1237” (namely,
“beneficial reimbursement,” if payment was made without the
knowledge or against the will of the old debtor; “reimbursement
and subrogation,” if it was made with the old debtor’s consent).

FACTS: Petitioner argues that its liability to respondent
has been extinguished by novation when it assigned and turned
over all its contracted works at the Heritage Park to the Heritage

HELD: This cannot bind respondent, who was not a
party to the assignment. Moreover, it has not been shown that
respondent gave his consent to the turnover. (See Art. 1293,

(10) ‘Novation’ Is a Civil Law Concept

The Article says “if the substitution is without the
knowledge or against the will of the debtor.” Now, then, suppose
it was with the knowledge or consent of the old debtor, will Art.
1294 still apply?

ANS.:
(a)

Literally construed, it would seem that the Article will
NOT apply; in other words, the old debtor would be liable.

(b)

But considering the intent of the law (and to distinguish
expromision from delegation), it is believed that the Article
would still apply, that is, the old debtor would still not be
liable for the new debtor’s insolvency or non-fulfillment.

issued checks. And in Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. v. Reynado,
627 SCRA 88 (2010), criminal liability for estafa is not affected
by compromise or novation of contract.

Art. 1294. If the substitution is without the knowledge
or against the will of the debtor, the new debtor’s insolvency
or non-fulfillment of the obligation shall not give rise to any
liability on the part of the original debtor.

Reason why the old debtor will not be responsible for the
new debtor’s INSOLVENCY or NON-FULFILLMENT: The
expromision was brought about without his initiative. (8
Manresa 439)

(2) Query

As a civil law concept (St. James College ofParanaque v.
Equitable PCI Bank, 627 SCRA 328(2010]), novation is never
presumed. For instance, the creditor’s acceptance of another

After all, the initiative did not come from him.

2)

A contrary conclusion would put him in a worse
position than in delegation, where liability is only for
insolvency and not for other kinds of non-fulfillment.

Art. 1295. The insolvency of the new debtor, who has been
proposed by the original debtor and accepted by the creditor,

For the old debtor to be liable if the new debtor is insolvent,
it is required that either of the following must be present:
(a)

The insolvency was already existing and of PUBLIC
KNOWLEDGE at the time of delegation;

(b)

OR the insolvency was already existing and KNOWN TO
THE DEBTOR at the time of delegation.
(Note that if the insolvency occurred only AFTER the
delegation, the old debtor is not liable.)

(3) Problem

Art 1296

Art. 1296. When the principal obligation is extinguished in
consequence of a novation, accessory obligations may subsist
only insofar as they may benefit third persons who did not
give their consent.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect on Accessory Obligation

Reason for the Article:

A owes B Pl,000,000. A proposed to B that C will pay A’s
debt, and that A will be released from all liabilities. B and C
agree to the proposal. Later, when B tries to collect from A, he
finds out that C is insolvent. It was proved that at the time of
delegation, C was already insolvent but this was not known to A.
Neither was the insolvency of public knowledge. Nevertheless, B
still sues A on the ground that it was A who made the proposal,
and that therefore A really guaranteed Cs insolvency. Decide.

ANS.: A is NOT liable, for the insolvency was neither of
public knowledge nor known to A at the time he delegated his
debt. The law does not require A to give a blanket guaranty.

Extinguishment of the principal obligation carries with it
the extinguishment of the accessory obligations (such as pledges,
mortgages, guaranties). (8 Manresa 441)
[NOTE: Article 1296 does not apply in cases of novation
by subrogation of the creditor. (See Art. 1303, Civil Code)]
(2) Modificatory Novation

Article 1296 applies in particular to extinctive novation. If
the novation is merely modificatory, are guarantors and sureties
released, if the novation is made WITHOUT their consent?

(Art. 1295)

ANS.:
(4) When Article Does Not Apply

It is understood that Art. 1295 does NOT apply if there
really was NO EXTINCTIVE NOVATION, such as:
(a) When the third person was only an agent, messenger, or
employee of the debtor.

When the third person acted only as guarantor or surety.
(c) When the new debtor merely agreed to make himself
solidarity liable for the obligation.
(d) When the new debtor merely agreed to make himself jointly
or partly responsible for the obligation. (Here the delegation
is merely with reference to the joint or proportionate share.)
(b)

528

(a)

If the modified obligation is now MORE ONEROUS, they
are liable only for the original obligation. (See Art. 2054,
Civil Code)

(b)

If the modified obligation is now LESS ONEROUS, the
guarantors and sureties are still responsible.

(3) Stipulation Contrary to Article 1296

May it be agreed that despite the extinguishment of the
old obligation, the accessory obligations would still remain as
accessory to the new obligation?
ANS.: Yes, provided that the debtors of said accessory
obligations give their consent.

Art 1297

(4) Effect on Stipulation Pour Autrui

I

The rule given in Art. 1296 referring to the automatic
extinction of all the accessory obligations speaks of one exception.
What is this?
ANS.: Accessory obligations or stipulations made in favor
of third persons (stipulations pour autrui) remain unless said
third persons have their consent to the novation.
Reason: Their rights to the accessory obligations (which for
them is really a distinct one) should not be prejudiced without
their consent. (See Art. 1311 of the Civil Code for examples of
stipulations pour autrui)

to novate, provided the signatures of C and D could be
obtained. But said signatures were never procured.

FACTS: A deed of sale was made validly. There was an
attempt to novate the same by two new deeds containing,

that instead of cash, D would give a particular car. Subsequently,
the car was destroyed by a fortuitous event. Is D obliged to give

P800,000?
ANS.: No, because the original obligation had already been
extinguished by the valid novation. Moreover, the obligation to

fortuitous event.

—

One of the requisites of a valid novation is that the
obligation be valid. THEREFORE
If the old obligation is VOID, there is no valid novation.
(b) If the old obligation was VOIDABLE and has already
been annulled, there is no more obligation. Therefore, the
novation is also void.

(a)

(2) Rule If the Old Obligation Was Voidable

Suppose the old obligation was VOIDABLE and has not
yet been annulled, may there be a valid novation?
ANS.: YES, provided that:
(a)

Annulment may be claimed only by the debtor,

(b)

Example: A was forced to sign a promissory note to
give B P500.000. Later the parties agreed voluntarily to let
the subject matter be a precious stone. Although the first
contract was voidable, the second one is all right because
in the first contract, annulment could be claimed only by
the debtor.
Or when ratification validates acts which are voidable.

Example: An agent, acting without authority from his
principal, bought merchandise from a company. Shortly
after he had learned of his agent’s act, the principal told the
seller to deliver another kind of merchandise, completely
different from the first. The seller agreed. Although the
first contract here was unauthorized, ratification by the
principal has cured its defects, and therefore the second
contract is valid.
[NOTE: Although Art. 1298 speaks of a “void” original
obligation, it evidently refers to a “VOIDABLE” one, where
annulment or ratification may exist. A void contract does

Loss

May an old obligation that has been extinguished by LOSS
of the subject matter be novated?

ANS.: It depends:
If the loss was purely because of a fortuitous event without
liability on the part of the debtor, the novation is VOID for
there would be NO obligation to novate.
(b) If the loss made the debtor liable, there is still an existing
monetary obligation that may be the subject of novation.
(See 8 Manresa 397-398)

(a)

(4) May a Prescribed Obligation Be the Subject of Novation?

Yes, because unless the defense of prescription is set up by
the debtor, the obligation continues, since this failure amounts
to a WAIVER. (Estrada v. Villareal, [CA.J 40 O.G. [5th Supp.]

p. 201)

[NOTE: A prescribed debt, constituting as it does a moral
or natural obligation, may be the cause or consideration of a new
obligation to pay therefor. (Villareal u. Estrada, 71 Phil. 140)]
(5) Effect on a VOIDABLE Obligation of Novation by

EXPROMISION
(a) Here the debtor is no doubt released from his obligation
to the creditor, for the substitution was not done through
his initiative.

(b)

BUT when the new debtor, after payment, sues the old
debtor for BENEFICIAL REIMBURSEMENT, the old
debtor can set up whatever defenses he could have set
against the creditor.

Therefore, there would be nothing to novate, since novation
requires the existence of a previous VALID and EFFECTIVE
obligation.
(3) Illustrative Problems

A promised to give B a car if B should pass the bar exams.
Later, both agreed that what should be given would be
a diamond ring. Nothing was mentioned in the second
contract regarding the condition. Is the new obligation also
subject to a suspensive condition?
ANS.: Yes, unless it was otherwise stipulated in the
new contract. The delivery of the diamond ring would,
therefore, be due only after B has passed the bar exams.
(b) A promised to give B a car unless X married Y. Later A
and B agreed to change the object to a precious stone. No
mention was made regarding any condition. Is the second
obligation subject to a resolutory condition?
ANS.: Yes, unless the contrary has been provided for
in the contract.
(c) In question (b), supposing under the same facts, X had
already married Y before A and B novated their contract,
what happens to the new obligation?
ANS.: It is as if the new obligation never arose, for
a contract that has already been extinguished cannot be
novated.

Art 1800

Government v. Bautista
(CA) 37 O.G. No. 97, p. 1880

FACTS: Pilar T. Bautista mortgaged certain
properties to the Postal Savings Bank. It was stipulated
in the contract that Bautista could transfer the mortgage
to anybody provided she complied with certain conditions
and requirements (for example, the payment of the interest
due, the transfer of title to the property to the assignee,
a deposit of a certain amount, etc.) Thereupon, Bautista
transferred the mortgage to Ocampo, without however
fulfilling the requirements although repeated demands
for their compliance had been made. The Bank made the
same demands on Ocampo but still the requirements were
not fulfilled.
ISSUE: Has there really been a substitution of debtor
here? Can the Bank still proceed to foreclose the mortgage
as against Bautista?

HELD: There has been no valid substitution of debtor
here and, therefore, no novation because the conditions
were not fulfilled. Therefore also, Bautista remains the
debtor, and the Bank can still proceed to foreclose the
mortgage against her. This is true despite the unquestioned
transfer of the mortgaged properties to Ocampo, because
the letters of demand did not by themselves constitute
sufficient reasons to release Pilar Bautista from her
obligation.

[NOTE: The Court of Appeals in the case of Cortes v.
Phil. Trust Co., (CA.) 45 O.G. No. 292, held, however, that an
assignment of a savings deposit in a bank is not a withdrawal
but a sort of subrogation, with the account being continued in
the name of the assignee.]

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1302

[NOTE: The answer will be the SAME if Solita paid
with Ligaya’s knowledge.]

Art. 1302. It is presumed that there is legal subrogation:

Suppose in the abovecited example, Solita paid Gloria only
Pl,300,000 for Ligaya’s total indebtedness (Gloria agreed
because of friendship), how much, concerning this debt,
may Solita successfully recover from Ligaya?

(1) When a creditor pays another creditor who is
preferred, even without the debtor’s knowledge;

ANS.: The whole Pl,500,000 because concerning this
debt, Solita steps completely into the shoes of Gloria.

(2) When a third person, not interested in the obligation,
pays with the express or tacit approval of the debtor;

(3) When, even without the knowledge of the debtor,
a person interested in the fulfillment of the obligation pays,
without prejudice to the effects of confusion as to the latter’s

share.

COMMENT:
(1) Legal Subrogation

This Article speaks of LEGAL subrogation. Under the old
Code, the word "legal" was not present. It was inserted here for
the sake of clarity.
(2) First Instance

“When a creditor pays another creditor who is preferred,

even without the debtor’s knowledge.”
(a)

Example:
Ligaya has two creditors: Gloria, who is a mortgage
creditor for Pl,500,000, and Solita, who is an ordinary
creditor for P600.000. Solita, without Ligaya’s knowledge,
paid Ligaya’s debt of P150.000 to Gloria. Here Solita will be
subrogated in the rights of Gloria. This means that Solita
will herself now be a mortgage creditor for Pl,500,000, and
an ordinary creditor for P600.000. If Ligaya fails to pay the
Pl,500,000 debt, Solita can have the mortgage foreclosed
(that is, the property can be sold at public
auction, with
Solita being paid from the proceeds thereof).
538

(b)

(c)

Suppose in problem (b), Solita paid the Pl,300,000 to Gloria
without Ligaya’s knowledge, but it turns out that at said
time of payment, Ligaya’s debt had already been reduced
to P300,000 (because of a prior partial payment), how much
can Solita successfully recover from Ligaya concerning this

debt?
ANS.: Only said P300.000 because this is only the
extent to which Ligaya had been benefited. It is Solita’s
fault that she did not first inform Ligaya of her intention
to pay. Solita’s remedy now would be to recover the excess
amount from Gloria.
[NOTE: In legal subrogation caused by payment to a
preferred creditor, may the debtor set up against the new
creditor defenses which he, the debtor, could have set up
against the old creditor?

ANS.: Yes, for after all, the subrogation took place
by operation of law. This effect differs from the effect of
CONVENTIONAL subrogation where the debtor gave his
consent.]

[NOTE: Examples of such defenses are the following:
causes of vitiated consent like force, intimidation, minority,
undue influence, error; other causes like prior payment
whether total or partial; remission; compensation, etc.]
[NOTE: For example of “preferred creditor” see Book
IV, Title XIX of the Civil Code on Preference of Credits.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(3) Second Instance

of course the guaranty is extinguished. This is what the
law means when it says that there is legal subrogation
“without prejudice to the effects of confusion as to the
latter’s (payor’s) share in the obligation.” (Art. 1302, par.

“When a third person, not interested in the obligation, pays
with the express or tacit approval of the debtor.”
(a)

Example:

3)

Eubolo owes Luna Pl,000,000 secured by a mortgage.
Blesilda, a classmate of Eubolo, and having no connection
with the contract at all, paid Luna the Pl,000,000 with
Eubolo’s approval. Is Blesilda subrogated in Luna’s place?
ANS.: Yes, because although not interested in
the obligation, she nevertheless paid off Luna with the
approval of the debtor. (Art. 1302, No. 2)
(b) If in the above example, Blesilda, who is Luna’s friend,
paid her only P700.000 for the extinguishment of Eubolo’s
debt, but the payment was made without the express or
tacit approval of Eubolo, what would be Blesilda’s rights,
if any?
ANS.: There is no legal subrogation here because there
was no express or implied approval of Eubolo. Therefore, all
that Blesilda can recover is P700.000 for this is the amount
with which she is supposed to be REIMBURSED (a giving
back to her of what she had DISBURSED). If Eubolo does
NOT pay, Blesilda cannot have the mortgage foreclosed.
For, as has been said, there has been no subrogation here.

(c)

Is a solidary debtor included in the scope of “a person
interested”?
1) Strictly speaking, NO, because when the solidary
debtor pays the whole obligation to the creditor,
solidary obligation itself is extinguished. Therefore,
it cannot be truly said that said solidary debtor steps
completely into the shoes of the creditor. Moreover,
although the other solidary debtors must reimburse
him, this obligation to reimburse is not solidary,
but merely joint, except of course that they are
all proportionately liable in the meantime for the
insolvency of one of them. (See Wilson u. Berkenkotter,
49 O.G. 1401)
2) In another (“loose") sense, the solidary debtor may
be said to fall under the category of an “interested
person” in that he steps in a way into the shoes of the
old creditor, since he would be entitled to COLLECT
reimbursement, but of course he cannot collect the
whole amount anymore in view of the “effect of
confusion (or merger) as to his share." (See Art. 1217,

Civil Code)

(4) Third Instance

“When, even without the knowledge of a debtor, a person
interested in the fulfillment of the obligation pays, without
prejudice to the effects of confusion as to the latter’s share.”
(a)

Examples of persons “interested”:
1)

Art. 1303

a guarantor

the owner of the property mortgaged as security for
the debtor’s debt
(b) Example of the Third Instance:
2)

D owes C Pl,000,000 secured by a mortgage and by
a guaranty of G. If G, even without Il's knowledge, pays
C the Pl ,000,000, G will be subrogated in O’s place. But
640

Art. 1303. Subrogation transfers to the person subrogated
the credit with all the rights thereto appertaining, either
against the debtor or against third persons, be they guarantors
or possessors of mortgages, subject to stipulation in a
conventional subrogation.

COMMENT:
(1) Effects of Subrogation

Note that the credit and all the appurtenant rights, either
against the debtor, or against third persons, are transferred
(thus, in a sense the obligation subsists, that is, it has not yet

been extinguished or paid).
641

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1304

(2) Example of the Effects of Subrogation

D owes C Pl,000,000. G is the guarantor. A stranger S
paid C the Pl.000,000 with the consent of D and C. S is now
subrogated in the place of C. If D cannot pay the Pl,000,000, S
can proceed against the guarantor, G.
(3) Effect of Presence of a Suspensive Condition

It is understood that if the transferred credit is subject
to a suspensive condition, the new creditor cannot collect until
after said condition is fulfilled. (See Gonzales Diez v. Delgado,
37 Phil. 389)

Art. 1304. A creditor, to whom partial payment has been
made, may exercise his right for the remainder, and he shall
be preferred to the person who has been subrogated in his
place in virtue of the partial payment of the same credit.

COMMENT:
(1) Partial Subrogation

Here, there are two creditors:
(a) the old creditor, who still remains a creditor as to balance
(because only a partial payment has been made to him);
(b) the new creditor who is a creditor to the extent of what he
had paid the creditor.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1304

Somes, 31 Phil. 76) Therefore, the old creditor must assert his
claim or preference over the assets only while they are still in
the hands of the sheriff who has levied on the properties. If done
later, the preference given by this article CEASES. (Molina v.
Somes, 31 Phil. 76, referring to a prior case Somes u. Molina,
15 Phil. 133)

—

Somes v. Molina
15 Phil. 133

FACTS: B bought property from X on the installment
plan (four installments). S acted as surety (a guarantor who
bound himself solidarity with B). When B failed to pay the first
installment, X sued B and S, and the judgment was satisfied
from S’s properties. Later, B again defaulted in the payment of
the other installments, and judgment was entered against him
S, fearful for his rights, then brought an action to have himself
declared subrogated in the rights of X. He did this because he
wanted to be paid first, from the assets of B. In other words, he
wanted to be preferred over X, the seller; he did not want X to
be paid first for the judgment.
HELD: S cannot be preferred. As a matter of fact, it is X
to whom the law grants preference because X is a creditor to
whom only a partial payment has been made.

—

—

[NOTE: Indeed, there was only a partial payment because
only one installment of the same debt had been paid. (See
Art. 1304)]

(2) Example

A owes B P500.000. With the consent of both, C pays B
P250,000. Now B and C are the creditors of A to the amount of
P250,000. Suppose A has only P250.000 who should be preferred?
ANS.: B, the original creditor, should be preferred inasmuch
as he is granted by the law (Art. 1304, Civil Code) preferential
right to recover the remainder, over the person subrogated in
his place by virtue of the partial payment of the same credit.
(3) Preference in the Assets

The preference is only in the assets remaining with the
debtor (not those already transferred to others). (Molina u.

who apparently was a “front” for someone else.

Art. 1306

(2017)

A contract, from the Latin "contractus" and from the
French “contract," is “a juridical convention manifested
in legal form, by virtue of which, one or more persons (or
parties) bind themselves in favor of another or others, or
reciprocally, to the fulfillment of a prestation to give, to do
or not to do.” (4 Sanchez Roman 148-149) “A contract is a
meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds
himself with respect to the other, to give something or to
render some service.” (Edilberto Alcantara v. Cornelio B.
Rita, Jr., GR 136996, Dec. 14, 2001)

It is the agreement of two or more persons (or parties)
for the purpose of creating, modifying, or extinguishing a
juridical relation between them. (Art. 1321, Italian Civil
Code and 2 Cas tan 184)

In the instant case, the Supreme Court had occasion to
opine that specific performance is “lt]he remedy of requiring exact performance of a contract

in the specific fares in which it was made, or according to
the precise terms agreed upon.

National Power Corp. v. EIN
GR 24856, Nov. 14, 1986

FACTS: NPC awarded EIN the contract to
deliver crude sulfur in one shipment on or before May
10, 1956. A bond posted by the PIS guaranteed the
obligation. EIN obtained from NPC a letter of credit
on May 8, 1956. Upon request of EIN, the NPC reset
the letter of credit to June 30, 1956. Upon BIN’s
further request, the NPC extended the expiry date
of the letter of credit to Dec. 30, 1956. On Aug. 19,
1956, EIN delivered 1,000 of the agreed 3,691 long
tons of sulfur ostensibly due to lack of bottoms. NPC
sued EIN for damages. The lower court dismissed the
case declaring that EIN did not act in bad faith.
HELD: The extensions of the expiry date of the
letter of credit cannot be interpreted as extensions
of delivery date. There is no relationship between
delivery date and opening of letter of credit which
was opened within a reasonable time after the signing
of the contract. NPC has been lenient by extending
the expiry date of the letter of credit. The problem of
bottoms is well-known and the NPC cannot be faulted
for such problem. EIN committed a breach of contract
by failing to completely deliver on its contract.

can take judicial notice (of), that there is a dearth and
acute shortage of inter-island vessels plying between
the country’s several islands, and the facilities they
offer leave much to be desired. Thus, even under
ordinary circumstances, the piers are congested with
passengers and their cargo waiting to be transported.
The conditions are even worse at peak and/or rainy
seasons, when passengers literally scramble to secure
whatever accommodations they may avail of, even
through circuitous routes, and/or at the risk of their
safety. Under these circumstances, it is hardly just
and proper to expect the passengers to examine thentickets received from crowded/congested counters,
more often than not, during rush hours, for conditions
that may be printed thereon, much less charge them
with having consented to the conditions so printed,
especially if there are a number of such conditions in
fine print, as in this case.
It should also be stressed that shipping com¬
panies are franchise-holders of certificates of public

convenience and, therefore, possess a virtual monopoly
over the business of transporting passengers between
the ports covered by their franchise. This being so,
shipping companies have a virtual monopoly of the
business of transporting passengers and may thus
dictate their terms of passage, leaving passengers
with no choice but to buy their tickets and avail of
their vessels and facilities. Finally , judicial notice may
be taken of the fact that the bulk of those who board
these inter-island vessels come from the low-income
groups and are less literate, and who have little or
no choice but to avail of petitioner’s vessels.
Angeles v. Calasanz
GR 42283, March 18, 1985

A contract of adhesion is so called because its
provisions are drafted by only one party, usually
a corporation, and the only participation of the
other party is to sign his name, his signature or his
“adhesion” to the contract. Insurance contracts, bills
of lading, contracts of sale of lots on installment plan
fall into this category. A contract to sell, drafted and
prepared by the seller and offered on a “take-it-orleave-it” basis to the buyers, who, being too eager to
acquire a lot upon which they could build their home
and without having had the chance to question or
change any of the terms of the agreement, assented to
its terms and conditions and affixed their signatures,
has some characteristics of a contract of adhesion.

The terms of a contract of sale which has the
characteristics of a contract of adhesion must be
construed and interpreted against the party who
drafted it, especially if the interpretation will help
effect justice to buyers who, after having invested a
big amount of money, are sought to be deprived of
the same through the application of a contract, clever
in its phraseology, condemnable in its lopsidedness
and injurious in its effect which, in essence, and in
its entirety, is most unfair to the buyers.

Arquero v. Hon. Flojo and RCPI
GR 68111, Dec. 20, 1988

FACTS: On Nov. 27, 1983, the petitioner and
private respondent Radio Communications of the
Phils., Inc. (RCPI), entered into a contract for services
for the transmission of a telegraphic message through
RCPI’s branch office in Aparri, Cagayan to Atty.
Eleazar S. Calasan at his office address in Quiapo,
Manila. The text of the telegram contract form for
transmission (as well as the telegram itself) reads:
“Send the following message subject to the
condition that the RCPI shall not be liable for
any damage, howsoever, same may arise except
for the refund of telegraph tolls. The sender
agrees that a condition precedent for a cause of
action against the RCPI any complaint relative
to the transmittal of this telegram must be
brought to the attention of the company within
three months from date, and the venue thereof
shall be in the courts of Quezon City alone and
in no other courts.

Atty. Eleazar S. Calasan received a copy of the

1983, at the birthday party of Asst. Fiscal Bonifacio
Sison in Quezon City, Atty. Calasan confronted and
censured the petitioner anent the said telegram.
Despite the petitioner’s explanation that the telegram
had been duly paid for, he was branded as a “stingy
553

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1305

Mayor who cannot even afford to pay the measly
sum of P7.30 for the telegram,” in the presence of
many persons. Thus, the petitioner filed an action
for damages against RCPI before the Regional Trial
Court of Aparri, Cagayan. RCPI filed a motion to
dismiss on the ground of improper venue, contending
that pursuant to the service contract, the parties had
agreed that the venue of any action which may arise
out of the transmittal of the telegram shall be in the
courts of Quezon City alone.

On Feb. 13, 1984, the trial court dismissed the
case and denied the motion for reconsideration re
said dismissal. Hence, the instant petition. Citing the
case of Sweet Lines, Inc. v. Bernardo Teves, et al., 83
SCRA 361, the petitioner claims that the condition
with respect to venue appearing on the ready printed
form of RCPI’s telegram for transmission is void and
unenforceable because the petitioner had no hand in
its preparation. The Court there held that contracts of
adhesion where the provisions have been drafted only
by one party and the only participation of the other
party is the signing of his signature or his adhesion
thereto, are contrary to public policy, as they are
injurious to the public or public good.
HELD: The agreement of the parties in the case
at bar as to venue is not contrary to law, public order,
public policy, morals or good customs. The parties do
not dispute that in the written contract sued upon,
it was expressly stipulated that any action relative
to the transmittal of the telegram against the RCPI
must be brought in the Courts of Quezon City alone.
We note that neither party to the contract reserved
the right to choose the venue of action as fixed by law,
i.e., where the plaintiff or defendant resides, at the
election of the plaintiff (Sec. 2, Rule 4, Rules of Civil
Procedure), as is usually done if the parties purported
to retain that right of election granted by the Rules.
Such being the case, it can reasonably be inferred
that the parties intended to definitely fix the venue of
action, in connection with the written contract sued
654

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1306

upon in the courts of Quezon City only. Section 3, Rule
4, Revised Rules of Court sanctions such stipulation
by providing that “by written agreement of the parties
the venue of action may be changed or transferred
from one province to another.” (Bautista u. de Borja,

18 SCRA 474)

In the instant case, the condition with respect
to venue in the telegram form for transmission was
printed clearly in the upper front portion of the form.
Considering the petitioner’s educational attainment
(being a lawyer by profession and the Municipal
Mayor ofSta. Teresita, Cagayan), he must be charged
with notice of the condition limiting the venue to
Quezon City, and by affixing his signature thereon,
he signified his assent thereto. Thus, the ruling in
Sweet Lines, Inc. v. Teves, et al., is not applicable in
this case.
BPI Express Card Corp. v. Eddie C. Olalia
GR 131086, Dec. 14, 2001
FACTS: Petitioner BPI Express Card Corp.
(BECC) operates a credit card system through which
it extends credit accommodations to its cardholders
for the purchase of goods and other services from
member-establishments of petitioner to be reimbursed
later by the cardholder upon proper billing.
Respondent Eddie C. Olalia was a credit
cardholder with a credit limit of P5.000. When
Olalia’s credit card expired, a renewal card was
issued. An extension card was also issued to Olalia’s
wife, Cristina. The extension card of Cristina was
used for purchases made from March to April 1991,
particularly in the province of Iloilo and Bacolod
City. Total unpaid charges from the use of this card
amounted to P101.844.54. Olalia denied having
applied for, much less receiving the extension card.
He further alleged that his wife, from whom he
was already divorced, left for the United States
in 1986 and has since resided there. In addition,
neither he nor Cristina was in Bacolod or Iloilo at
556

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1306

the time the questioned purchases were made. He
admitted responsibility for the amount of P13,883.27,
representing purchases made under his own credit
card.
A case for collection was filed against Olalia. The
trial court initially found Olalia liable for the amount
of P13,883.27 only. On motion for reconsideration filed
by petitioner, the trial court ordered Olalia to pay the
sum ofP136,290.97. On appeal, the Court of Appeals
(CA) sustained Olalia and made him liable for only
P13.883.27 with interest at 3% per month in addition
to a penalty fee of 3% of the amount due every month,
until full payment. Hence, this petition.

HELD: Petition is denied and with the CA’s
decision being affirmed.

Contracts of this nature are contracts of
adhesion, so-called because their terms are prepared
by only one party while the other merely affixes his
signature signifying his adhesion thereto. As such,
their terms are construed strictly against the party
who drafted it. In this case, it was BECC who made
the foregoing stipulation, thus, they are now tasked
to show vigilance for its compliance.
(m) According to the nature of the contract:
1)

personal

2)

impersonal

Insular Life Assurance, Ltd. v. Ebrado
80 SCRA 181
The contract of life insurance is an example of a
“personal” contract. (This is because upon the death of
the insured, the contract ceases to exist. Indemnities,
in the proper case will, of course, be given.)
(4) Stages of a Contract

(a)

—

Preparation (or Conception or “Generation’)
Here the
parties are progressing with their negotiations; they have
556

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1306

not yet arrived at any definite agreement, although there
may have been a preliminary offer and bargaining.
(b) Perfection (or birth) — Here the parties have at long last
came to a definite agreement, the elements of definite
subject matter and valid cause have been accepted by
mutual consent.
(c) Consummation (or death or termination) Here the terms
of the contract are performed, and the contract may be said
to have been fully executed.

—

(S) Parties to a Contract
(a)

The law speaks of a meeting of minds between two
“persons.” The meeting of the minds really refers to two
“parties.” If at the time of supposed perfection, one of
the parties had already previously died, there can be no
meeting of the minds; hence, no contract. ( Coronel v. Ona,
33 Phil. 456)
Marimperio Compania Naviera, SA. v.
Court of Appeals
GR 40234, Dec. 14, 1987
A contract takes effect between the parties who made
it, and also their assigns and heirs, except in cases where
the rights and obligations arising from the contract are
not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation, or by
provision of law. Since a contract may be violated by the
parties thereto, as against each other, in an action upon
that contract, the real parties in interest, either as plaintiff
or as defendant, must be parties to said contract. Therefore,
a party who has not taken part in it cannot sue or be sued
for performance or for cancellation thereof, unless he shows
that he has a real interest affected thereby.

Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals and
Spouses Sotero Cailipan, Jr. and
Zenaida Lopez and George L. Cailipan
GR 80447, Jan. 31, 1989
Since a contract may be violated only by the parties
thereto, as against each other, in an action upon that
contract, the real parties-in-interest, either as plaintiff
557

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1306

or as defendant, must be parties to said contract. A real
party-in-interest-plaintiff is one who has a legal right,
while a real party-in-interest-defendant is one who has a
correlative legal obligation whose act or omission violated
the legal right of the former. In the absence of any contract
of carriage between the common carrier and the parents of
the injured party, the latter are not real parties-in-interest
in an action for breach of that contract.
The general rule of the common law is that every
action must be brought in the name of the infringed. For
the immediate wrong and damage, the person injured is
the only one who can maintain the action. The person who
sustains an injury is the person to bring an action for the
injury against the wrongdoer.
(b)

(c)

While a promissory note is unilateral (in that only one party
has signed it and is bound thereby), still such a contract
includes two parties (the debtor and the creditor). Thus,
the signer is not the only party, nor the only one who can
sue on such a contract. There can be no obligor without an
obligee. (Dilag v. Heirs of Fortunato Resurrection, 76 Phil.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1306

(7) Co-existence of a Contract with a Quasi-Delict (Tort)

The existence of a contract between the parties does not
constitute a bar to the commission of a tort by one against the
other, and the consequent recovery of damages. (Araneta v. de
Joya, L-25172, May 24, 1974)
(8) Legal Effects of a Contract

— How Determined

Adoracion E. Cruz, et al. v. Court of Appeals &
Spouses Eliseo & Virginia Malolos
GR 126713, July 27, 1998

Contracts constitute the law between the parties. They
must be read together and interpreted in a manner that
reconciles and gives life to all of them. The intent of the parties,
as shown by the clear language used, prevails over post facto
explanations that find no support from the words employed by
the parties or from their contemporary and subsequent acts
showing their understanding of such contracts. A subsequent
agreement cannot novate or change by implication a previous
one, unless the old and new contracts are, on every point,

650)

incompatible with each other.

The meeting of the minds may arise because of an express
or implied accord (such as when services as an interpreter
and guide, whether solicited or not, were accepted and
duly rendered; here, an obligation to pay for such services
exists). (See Perez v. Pomar, 2 Phil. 682)

Indeed, the legal effects of a contract are determined by
extracting the intention of the parties from the language they
used and from their contemporaneous and subsequent acts. This
principle gains more force when third parties are concerned. To
require such persons to go beyond what is clearly written in the
document is unfair and unjust. They cannot possibly delve into
the contracting parties’ minds and suspect that something is
amiss, when the language of the instrument appears clear and
unequivocal.

(9) Delivery of the Thing

People v. Lacap
GR 139114, Oct 23, 2001
FACTS: Accused-s/iabu supplier, a former military officer
trained in narcotics operation, anti-terrorism, and military
tactics denied the existence of any buy-bust operation, and
alleged that the whole operation was a frame-up. The lower
court convicted the supplier. On appeal, he contended that there
559

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1305

was no actual delivery of the drug to the poseur-buyer, thus, he
should be acquitted of the charge because one of the elements
of the crime had not been established. There are two elements
necessary for the prosecution of the crime of illegal sale of shabu
under Sec. 15, Art. Ill of RA 6425, as amended by Sec. 20, Art.
IV of RA 7659, namely: (1) identity of buyer and seller, object,
and consideration; and (2) delivery of thing sold and payment
therefor.
ISSUE: Was the supplier correct in his contention?

HELD: No. Although the supplier did not actually hand the
contraband to the buyer, he placed it on top of the vault where
the latter could have easily gotten it after paying him. There
was, thus, a constructive delivery of the drug. The fact that the
supplier tried to put the shabu back inside the vault is of no
moment as the crime had by then been already consummated.
There is no rule which requires that in a buy-bust operation there
must be a simultaneous exchange of the money and the drug by
the poseur-buyer and the pusher. Nor was it important that the
“boodle” money was not presented in court. What is material to
the prosecution of the illegal sale of dangerous drugs is proof
that the transaction actually took place with the presentation
in court of the corpus delicti or the substantial fact that a crime
has been committed.

path, graded trail, plantation road, bunkhouse, and look¬
out tower.
Spread out during the three-year period is the annual
maintenance, protection, administration and supervision, and
monitoring and evaluation of the project area.
ISSUE: Whether petitioners’ argument that they are not
bound to fully plant/establish the whole 50 hectares during the
first year of operations is meritorious?
HELD: The argument is without merit. Clearly, based on
said schedule, petitioners were to undertake the principal task
of planting the 50 hectare-project area during the first year of
the project. What is to be carried out during the entire three-year
period is the maintenance and aftercare of the project site, and
petitioners were to turn over the project at the end of the third
year fully planted and established.

FACTS: Under the reforestation contract, petitioners
were to turn over at the end of the third year the project area
fully planted and properly maintained. However, the Project
Development Plan, appended and made integral part of the
contract, specifically defines and details petitioners’ undertaking.
Under the Plan, the following tasks were to be completed during
the first year of the project:

survey and mapping of the whole 50 hectares;

(2)

nursery operations for fast-growth, medium-growing, and
slow-growth species;

FACTS: Respondents failed to fully comply with their
obligation under the contract, having accomplished only 90%

The non-impairment clause under Sec. 10, Art. Ill of the
1987 Phil. Const, is limited in application to laws that derogate
from prior acts or contracts by enlarging, abridging, or in any
manner changing the intention of the parties.

Art. 1306. The contracting parties may establish such
stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem
convenient, provided they are not contrary to law, morals,
good customs, public order, or public policy.

COMMENT:
(1) The Principle of Freedom

This Article stresses the principle of freedom. The free
entrance into contracts generally without restraint is one of
the liberties guaranteed to the people. (People v. Pomar, 46
Phil. 440) However, the constitutional prohibition against the
impairment of contractual obligations refers only to contracts
which are legal, not to void or inexistent ones. (San Diego v.
Mun. ofNaujan, L-9920, Feb. 29, 1960)
Denila, Gubatanga and Inayan v. Bellosillo
L-39569, May 16, 1975
(Litigants May Enter into a Contract of Compromise)

FACTS: To put an end to a case pending before the Court
of Agrarian Relations in Iloilo, the parties thereto (the Beaterio
562

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1306

del Santisimo Rosario de Molo, owner of a 13-hectare riceland
and its tenants, Denila, Gubatanga, and Inayan) entered into a
judicial compromise on April 24, 1972 whereby the landowner
agreed to cede by way of CIVIL LEASE (not agricultural lease
or lease tenancy) to the latter certain parts of the land for two
agricultural years, with the rentals therefor being specified.
The contract also stated that should the rent be unpaid, the
landowner will have the right to put an end to the lease and
to ask for a writ of execution whereby possession would be
returned to the landowner. Because the rent was not paid,
landowner moved for a writ of execution. Tenants alleged that
in view of the existence of a civil lease, the Agrarian Court has
lost jurisdiction over the case, and hence, can no longer issue a
writ of execution, and that finally, they can be ejected from the
land only in an unlawful detainer suit instituted in the proper
municipal court.

ISSUE: Does the CAR (Court of Agrarian Relations) still
have jurisdiction to issue the writ applied for?

HELD: Yes, the CAR has such jurisdiction. Since originally
it had jurisdiction because of the agrarian conflict, said
jurisdiction continues until the case is finally ended. And the
case can end precisely by the issuance and enforcement of a writ
of execution (an enforcement contemplated by the parties). The
compromise agreement is a contract binding on the parties and
an admission by them of the just determination of their rights.
Being embodied in a court judgment, it has upon the parties the
effect and authority of RES JUDICATA, enforceable by a writ
of execution. Indeed, the CAR, being vested with jurisdiction
to render the decision based on the compromise agreement,
has the power and authority to enforce it in the same case. It
is not right for a party who had invoked the court’s jurisdiction
in order to procure a particular relief to deny afterwards that
same jurisdiction so as to avoid a writ of execution.

necessity, as when he is 75 years old, sick, needs money for
his illness, and is jobless. He is exempt from the suspension
decreed in PD 20. In fact, the monthly rent here of P500 is a
mere pittance, and the lease may be considered a gratuitous one.
Besides, the lessee is much better off than the latter because
he (lessee) owns a much bigger land in the city. The decree is
precisely designed to alleviate the living conditions of those in
need.
(3) Limitations Imposed by Law

In the case of Abe, et al. v. Foster Wheeler Corporation,
et al., L-14785, Nov. 29, 1960 and L-14923, Nov. 29, 1960,
the appellant companies contended that as the contracts of
employment were entered into at a time when there was NO
law granting the workers one month pay, the application as
to them of RA 1052 restoring the same right constitutes an
impairment of their contractual obligations. There is no merit
in this contention. The freedom of contract under the present
system of government is NOT meant to be absolute. The same
is understood to be subject to reasonable legislative regulations
aimed at the promotion of public health, morals, safety, and
welfare. In other words, the constitutional guaranty of non¬
impairment of obligations is limited by the exercise of the
police power of the State. The question then to be determined
is whether RA 1052 is a regulatory measure, not a substantive
law, so that its enactment may properly be considered a valid
exercise of police power. The answer is in the affirmative. The
Act prescribes the manner of terminating employment, that is,
without a fixed or definite period by requiring the employer or
employee, before terminating such employment, to notify the
other party of such fact. Evidently, the purpose is to give the
other party opportunity to find replacement, in the case of the
employer, and another place of employment, in the case of the
employee. The right to be thus notified can hardly be considered
substantive. The act is merely REGULATORY.

Ochengco v. City Court of Zamboanga

The contractual stipulations must not be contrary to
mandatory and prohibitive laws. (Art. 5, Civil Code)
Directory and suppletory laws need not be complied with,
since these are either discretionary, or merely supply the
omissions of the parties. (8 Manresa 620)

(b)

Contracts must respect the law, for the law forms part of the
contract. Indeed, the provisions of all laws are understood
to be incorporated in the contract. (Commissioner of Int.
Revenue v. United Lines Co., L-16850, May 20, 1962) [Thus,
the right to overtime compensation and to wages, although
granted by law, is nevertheless implicitly included in every
contract of employment-, and therefore the prescriptive
period is that provided for contracts, oral or written, as the
case may be, and not the prescriptive period for enforcing
a right given by law. (Flores, et al. v. San Pedro, et al.,
L-8580, Sept. 30, 1957)]

the lessor from demanding an increase thereof, the lessor
had the right to do so.

Likewise, an "upset price" is not allowed in a mortgage
contract. An upset price is a specified price below which
the mortgaged property is not supposed to be sold at the
execution sale. (Warner, Barnes and Co. v. Jaucian, 13
Phil. 4)

The parties to a contract cannot deprive a competent court
of its jurisdiction, because jurisdiction is fixed by law, and
not by the will of the parties. (Molina v. De la Riva, 6 Phil.
12) However, venue, or the place where the action may be
brought, can be the subject of stipulation. (Rule 4, Sec. 4,
Revised Rules of Court; and Central Azucarera v. De Leon,
56 Phil. 169)

FACTS: D lost in gambling and as payment, executed

HELD: No, because the promissory note is void. Just
as the winner cannot recover, so also cannot the assignee.
[NOTE: If the loser had borrowed money from a friend
through a promissory note, said money to be used to pay
the winner, the promissory note is valid for it was not the
result of gambling between the loser and the friend. Thus,
while a winner in gambling cannot recover, a friend who
lends the money can recover.]

Morals deal with right and wrong (See De los Reyes v.
Alojado, 16 Phil. 499) and with human conscience. (Ibarra
v. Aveyro, 33 Phil. 273)

De los Reyes v. Alojado
16 Phil. 499

FACTS: A debtor agreed to work as a servant for her
creditor WITHOUT PAY until she could find money with
which to pay her debt. After sometime she left without
paying, so the creditor instituted this action to compel
her to pay, and work as a servant without pay til the debt
could finally be paid. The debtor, on the other hand, asked
payment for services already rendered.
HELD:The agreement to work without pay is immoral
and void since this would amount to involuntary servitude.
The creditor was ordered to pay wages and to subtract
therefrom the amount of the debt.
Emeterio Cui v. Arellano University
2 SCRA 205
FACTS: A student who had finished 3 1/2 semesters
in the College of Law of the Arellano University transferred
to another law school for his last semester. For the 3 1/2
semesters he stayed at the Arellano University, he enjoyed
a scholarship; hence, was not required to pay fees. When he
sought transfer and his transcript of grades, he was asked
to reimburse all the scholarship funds since the agreement
precisely provided for a refund in case of transfer.

ISSUE: Is such a proviso valid?
HELD: The proviso is void, and contravenes both
morals and public policy. Scholarships should not be
propaganda matter, they are awards for merit. Hence, the
student need not reimburse.

Saturnino Selanova v. Alejandro E. Mendoza
Adm. Matter-804-CJ
May 19, 1975
FACTS: A judge (and notary public) prepared and
ratified a document dated Nov. 21, 1972, liquidating
extrajudicially a conjugal partnership and allowing the
married couple concerned to waive their right to prosecute
each other for future acts of infidelity.

ISSUE: Are said stipulations in the public instrument
considered valid?
HELD: Both stipulations are contrary to law, good
customs, morals, and public policy, and the notarizing
official can therefore be punished administratively.
While it is true that in Lacson v. San Jose-Lacson,
L-23482, L-23767, and L-24259, Aug. 30, 1968, 24 SCRA

made during the marriage, still the judicial sanction must
be obtained BEFOREHAND, not subsequently.
The license given to either spouse to commit any act
of infidelity was, in effect, a ratification of their personal

separation and, therefore, a violation of Art. 221 of the
Civil Code prohibiting contracts for “personal separation,
between husband and wife” (and for every extrajudicial
agreement for the dissolution of the conjugal partnership
or of the absolute community of property between the
husband and the wife).

LL and Company Development and AgroIndustrial Corp. v. Huang Chao Chun
and Yang Tung Fa
GR 142378, March 7, 2002

FACTS: Petitioner argues that respondents should
be ejected for non-payment of the new rental rates. That
is, the monthly rental is subject to increase. Said increase
shall be based upon the imposition of Real Estate Tax for
every two years upon presentation of the increased real

estate tax to the lessees, but said increase shall not be less
than 25%.
Respondents, upon the other hand, counter that
they did not agree to these new rates. The former denied
petitioner’s allegations, claiming instead that their failure
to pay the monthly rentals on the property was due to
petitioner’s fault when it attempted to increase the amount
of rent in violation of their contract.

HELD: A unilateral increase in the rental rate cannot
be authorized considering that: (1) the option to renew is
reciprocal and, thus, the terms and conditions thereof
must likewise be reciprocal;
including the rental rate
and (2) the contracted clause authorizing an increase
“upon presentation of the increased real estate tax to
lessees” has not been complied with, in the instant case,
by petitioner.

—

— —

—

A stipulation in a lease contract stating that it is
subject to “an option to review” shall be interpreted to
be reciprocal in character. Unless the language shows an
intent to allow the lessee to exercise it unilaterally, such
option shall be deemed to benefit both the lessor and the
lessee who must both consent to the extension or renewal,
as well as to its specific terms and conditions.
569

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1306

In the instant case, there was nothing in the aforesaid
stipulation or in the actuation of parties that showed they
intended an automatic renewal or extension of the term of
the contract. Thus:
1.

Demonstrating petitioner’s disinterest in renewing
the contract was its letter dated Aug. 23, 1996,
demanding that respondents vacate the premises
for failure to pay rentals since 1993. As a rule, the
owner-lessor has the prerogative to terminate the
lease upon its expiration. (Vda. de Roxas v. CA, 63

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(5) Limitations Imposed by Good Customs

Good customs are those that have received for a period of
time practical and social confirmation. According to the Code
Commission, good customs and morals “overlap each other, but
sometimes they do not.” (Commission Report, p. 134)
(6) Limitations Imposed by Public Order
(a)

SCRA 302 [1975])

3.

। ,.

In the present case, the disagreement of the parties
over the increased rental rate and private respondents’
failure to pay it, precluded the possibility of a mutual
renewal.
The fact that the lessor allowed the lessee to introduce
improvements on the property was indicative, not
of the former’s intention to extend the contract
automatically (Buce v. CA, 332 SCRA 151 [2000]), but
merely of its obedience to its express terms allowing
the improvements. After all, at the expiration of
the lease, those improvements were to “become its
property.”

As to the contention that it is not fair to eject
respondents from the premises after only five years,
considering the value of the improvements they introduced
therein, suffice it to say that they did so with knowledge of
the risk - the contract had plainly provided for a five-year
lease period.

Parties are free to enter into any contractual
stipulation, provided it is not illegal or contrary to public
morals. When such agreement, freely and voluntarily
entered into, turn out to be disadvantageous to a party,
courts cannot rescue it without crossing the constitutional
right to contract. They are not authorized to extricate
parties from the necessary consequences of their acts, and
the fact that the contractual stipulations may turn out to
be financially disadvantageous will not relieve the latter
of their obligations. (Torres v. CA, 320 SCRA 430 [1999])
670

Art. 1306

Public order deals with the public weal (Bough v. Cantiveros,
40 Phil. 209), and includes public safety. (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 134)
Villanueva v. Castaneda, Jr.
GR 61311, Sept. 21, 1987

Every contract affecting public interest suffers
a congenital infirmity in that it contains an implied
reservation of the police power as a postulate of the existing
order. This power can be activated at any time to change
the provisions of the contract, or even abrogate it entirely,
for the promotion or protection of the general welfare. Such
act will not militate against the impairment clause, which
is subject to and limited by the paramount police power.
(b)

Public order as used in the old Civil Code was synonymous
with public policy. (Ferrazzini u. Gsell, 34 Phil. 697)

(7) Limitations Imposed by Public Policy

Public policy, which varies according to the culture of a
particular country, is the “public, social and legal interest
in private law.” (Ferrazzini v. Gsell, 34 Phil. 697) It is said
to be the manifest will of a State.
(b) A contract is contrary to public policy if it “has a tendency to
injure the public, is against the public good, or contravenes
some established interest of society, or is inconsistent with
sound policy and good morals, or tends clearly to undermine
the security of individual’s rights.” (Gabriel v. Monte de
Piedad, 71 Phil. 500)

policy:

those which tend to stifle the prosecution of a person

[NOTE: In a few cases, a compromise is,
however, permitted.]
those exempting a carrier from liability for gross
negligence. (Heacock v. Macondray, 32 Phil. 205)
those which encourage fraud. (Bough v. Cantiveros,
40 Phil. 209)
those which authorize any attorney selected by the
creditor to state before the court, should suit for
collection be brought, that the debtor recognizes the
existence and validity of the debt. (These are called
“warrants of attorney to confess judgment.” These
are void because they deprive the debtor of his day
in court.) (National Bank v. Manila Oil Refining Co.,
43 Phil. 444)
those which constitute an undue or unreasonable
restraint of trade, such as a prohibition to engage
in any enterprise (whether similar or not with the
enterprise of the employer) within a period of five
years after leaving the service of the employer.
(Ferrazzini v. Gsell, 34 Phil. 697) (If the restraint is
reasonable, it should be given effect.) (Ollendorf v.
Abrahamson, 38 Phil. 585; and Red Line v. Bachrach

Adm. Case 724, Jan. 31, 1969
If a lawyer in a case buys the subject matter involved
in the litigation during said litigation, the purchase would

his entry into the case as counsel, the purchase must be
regarded as a valid transaction.

Leal, et al. v. LAC
GR 65425, Nov. 5, 1987

FACTS: A contract entitled “compraventa," written
entirely in the Spanish language, provided that ‘en caso
de venta, no podran vender a otros dischos lotes de terreno
sino al aqui vendedro o los herederos or sucesores de este
x x x.* This is an express prohibition against the sale of
the lots described in the “compraventa" to third persons or
strangers.

HELD: The provision is a nullity. A prohibition to
alienate should not exceed at most a period of 20 years;
otherwise, there would be subversion of public policy which
naturally frowns on unwarranted restrictions on the right
of ownership.

Top-Weld Manufacturing, Inc. v.

GR 44944, Aug. 9, 1985

The rule of pari delicto is expressed in the maxim “ex

an illegal agreement. It leaves the parties where it finds

call it. (Quiroga v. Parsons Hardware Co., 38 Phil. 501)

them.
Thus, a contract entered into by a domestic corporation
with a foreign corporation to make and sell the latter’s
products is illegal if the latter is not licensed to do business
in the Philippines by the Board of Investments under RA
5455. But if the domestic corporation is in pari delicto,
it cannot ask our courts to stop the foreign corporation
from terminating the contract and from negotiating with
and transferring its license to produce and distribute its
products to third persons.
(8) Examples of Stipulations Which Have Been Declared

Valid
A stipulation limiting the liability of a guarantor or surety
for only one year (or as long as it is for a longer time than
the period fixed for the principal debtor). (Jollye v. Barcelon
and Luzon Surety Co., 50 O.G., p. 217; 68 Phil. 164)
(b) A stipulation in a fire insurance policy that the action by
the insured should be brought within a reasonable time.
(Macias & Co. v. China Fire Insurance Co., 46 Phil. 345)
(c) A stipulation that interest on loans be compounded. (Gov’t,
v. Vaca, 64 Phil. 6)

(d)

A stipulation that an employee may be dismissed at
anytime when his services are no longer needed; or that an
employee may leave the services of the employer, without
previous notice. (Borrowsky v. Isako, [CA.] 40 O.G. 12th
Supp., p. 264)

(e)

A stipulation to pay a debt, incurred during the Japanese
occupation, in Philippine currency after liberation. (De
Leon v. Syjuco, Inc., 90 Phil. 311)

(f)

A stipulation in a contract of lease, allowing the tenant to
retain the rents of the house for the payment of repairs
and taxes. (De los Reyes v. De los Reyes, 8 Phil. 803)

(9) Designation of the Name of a Contract
(a)

The parties generally may agree on any contract, but the
name that they give to it should not be controlling, for a
574

Art. 1306

(b)

This is because a contract must be judged by its character,
its nature, and its legal qualifications. The courts will,
therefore, look not so much at the form of the transaction
as at its substance. (Gabriel v. Monte de Piedad, 71 Phil.

497)

(10) Insurance Contract

UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc. v.
Masagana Telemart, Inc.
GR 137172, April 4, 2002
FACTS: Respondent, which had procured insurance
coverage from petitioner for a number of years, had been
granted a 60 to 90-day credit term for the renewal of policies.
Such a practice had existed up to the time the claims were filed.
Moreover, there was preponderant proof that no timely notice
of non-renewal was made by petitioner.
ISSUE: Whether or not the fire insurance policies issued by
petitioner to respondent covering the period from May 22, 1991
to May 22, 1992 had been extended or renewed by an implied
credit arrangement though actual payment or premium was
tendered on a later date and after the occurrence of the fire-risk
insured against.

HELD: The insurer may grant credit extension for payment
of premium. This simply means that if insurer has granted the
insured a credit term for premium payment and loss occurs
before expiration of term, recovery on the policy should be
allowed even though premium is paid after the loss but within
the credit term. There is nothing in Sec. 77 of the Insurance
Code of 1978 which prohibits parties in an insurance contract to
provide a credit term within which to pay the premiums. That
agreement is not against the law, morals, good customs, public
order, or public policy. The agreement binds the parties. (See
Art. 1306, Civil Code)

In the instant case, it would be unjust and inequitable if
recovery on the policy would not be permitted against petitioner,
which had consistently granted a 60 to 90-day credit term
575

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

for payment of premium despite its full awareness of Sec.77
aforementioned above. Estoppel tears it from taking refuge
under said section, since respondent relied in good faith on such
practice.

San Miguel Corp. v. NLRC
GR 80774, May 31, 1988

The innovation program sponsored by a corporation
inviting its employees to submit innovation proposals
and the corporation undertaking to grant cash awards to
employees who accept such invitation and whose innovative
suggestions, in the judgment of the corporation’s officials,
satisfied the standards and requirements of the program
and which, therefore, could be translated into some
substantial benefit to the corporation, though a unilateral
undertaking in origin, could nonetheless ripen into an
enforceable (facio ut des) obligation on the part of the
corporation under certain circumstance.

as LEASE)
(2) this agreement may be considered one of the
innominate contracts expressly allowed under Art.

(3) Legal Services for a Friend

Corpus v. Court of Appeals
98 SCRA 424

If an attorney renders legal services for a close friend, the
former can still charge attorney’s fees even in the absence of any
agreement thereon. This is because of the innominate contract of
577

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1308

facio ut des (I do that you may give) which, in turn, is based on
the principle that one cannot unjustly enrich himself at another’s

expense.
Art. 1308. The contract must bind both contracting
parties; its validity or compliance cannot be left to the will
of one of them.

COMMENT:
(1) Mutuality of Contracts

—

This Article stresses the mutuality of contracts that is,
both parties are bound. The principle is based on the essential
equality of the parties. It is repugnant to bind one party, and
yet leave the other free. (Garcia v. Rita Legarda, Inc., L-20175,
Oct. 30, 1967)

Alcuaz v. PSBA, et al.
GR 76353, May 2, 1988
FACTS: For taking part in a demonstration or protest
which the school authorities branded as “anarchic” rallies,
certain students were barred from re-enrollment while some
teachers were dismissed. The affected students and teachers
alleged that they have been deprived of procedural due process
which requires that there be due notice and hearing, and of
substantive due process which requires that the person or body
to conduct the investigation be competent to act and decide, free
from bias and prejudice. It is not disputed that Printed Rules
and Regulations of the school are distributed at the beginning
of each school year to the students. The Rules, among others,
provide: “Enrollment in the PSBA is contractual in nature
and upon admission to the school, the student is deemed to
have agreed to bind himself to all rules and regulations by the
Department of Education, Culture and Sports. Furthermore, he
agrees that he may be required to withdraw from the school at
any time for reasons deemed sufficiently serious by the School
Administration.”
HELD: Paragraph 137 of the Manual of Regulations for
Private Schools provides that when a college student registers
578

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1308

in a school, it is understood that he is enrolling for the entire
semester. The Manual also provides that the “written contract”
required for college teachers are for “one semester.” It is beyond
dispute that a student once admitted to school is considered
enrolled for one semester. Evidently, after the close of the
semester the school has no longer any existing contract either
with the students or with the intervening teachers. Such being
the case, the charge of denial of due process is untenable. For
contracts are respected as the law between the contracting
parties. And the courts, be they the original trial court or the
appellate court, have no power to make contracts for the parties.
(2) Consequences of MUTUALITY
(a)

A party cannot revoke or renounce a contract without the
consent of the other, nor can it have it set aside on the
ground that he had made a bad bargain. (Fernandez v.
MRR, 14 Phil. 274)

(b)

When the fulfillment of the condition depends upon the
sole will of the debtor, the conditional obligation is void
(Art. 1182, Civil Code) if the condition is SUSPENSIVE. If
RESOLUTORY, the obligation is valid. Hence, it is all right
for the contract to expressly give to one party the right to
CANCEL the same. This is because, when the contract is
thus cancelled, the agreement is really being FULFILLED.
(Taylor u. Uy Tieng Piao and Tan Liuan, 43 Phil. 873)
[NOTE: When a cancellation is made, BOTH parties
must of course be released.]

Melencio v. Dy Tiao
5 Phil. 99
FACTS: Two persons entered into a contract of lease
of land. It was stipulated that at any time before the tenant
constructed any building thereon, he could cancel the lease.

ISSUE: Is the stipulation valid?

HELD: Yes, for here again, when cancellation is
made, this by itself is a fulfillment of the provisions of the

contract.

579

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1308

PNB v. Court of Appeals

GR 88880, April 30, 1991
FACTS: The Philippine National Bank (PNB) over
the objection of debtor, and without authority from the
Monetary Board, within a period of only four months,
increased the 18% interest rate on the borrower’s loan
obligation three times: (a) to 32% in July 1984; (b) to 41%
in Oct. 1984; and (c) to 48% in Nov. 1984.
HELD: Those increases were null and void, for if the
Monetary Board itself was not authorized to make such
changes oftener than once a year, even less so may a bank,
which is subordinate to the Board. While the debtor did
agree in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage that the interest
rate may be increased during the life of the contract “to
such increase within the rate allowed by law, as the Board
of Directors of the Mortgagee may prescribe” or “within
the limits allowed by law,” no law was ever passed in
July to Nov. 1984 increasing the interest rates on loans or
renewals thereof to 32%, 41% and 48% (per annum), and
no documents were executed and delivered by the debtor
to effectuate the increase. Central Bank Circular 905,
Series of 1982 removed the Usury Law ceiling on interest
rates, but it did not authorize the PNB, or any bank for
that matter, to unilaterally and successively increase the
agreed rate of interest rates from 18% to 48% within a span
of four months, in violation of PD 116 which limits such
changes to “once every twelve months.”
Besides, violating PD 116, the unilateral action of the
PNB in increasing the interest rate on the borrower’s loan
violated the mutuality of contracts ordained in Art. 1308
of the Civil Code. In order that obligations arising from
contracts may have the force of law between the parties,
there must be mutuality between the parties based on
their essential quality. A contract containing a condition
which makes its fulfillment dependent exclusively upon the
uncontrolled will of one of the contracting parties is void.
And even assuming that the Pl.8 million loan agreement
between the PNB and the borrower gave the PNB a license
(although in fact there was none) to increase the interest
680

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1308

rate at will during the term of the loan, that license would
have been null and void for being violative of the principle of
mutuality essential on contracts. It would have invested the
loan agreement with the character of a contract of adhesion,
where the parties do not bargain on equal footing, the
weaker party’s (the debtor’s) participation being reduced
to the alternative “take it or leave it.” Such a contract is a
trap for the weaker party whom the courts of justice must
protect against abuse and imposition. PNB’s successive
increase of the interest rate on the borrower’s loan, over the
latter’s protest, were arbitrary as they violated an express
provision of the Credit Agreement, Sec. 9.01, that its terms
“may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed
by the party to be bound as burdened by such amendment.”
The increases imposed by the PNB also contravene Art.
1956 of the Civil Code which provides that “no interest
shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in
writing.” Here, the debtor never agreed in writing to pay
the interest increases fixed by the PNB beyond the 24% per
annum-, hence, he is not bound to pay a higher rate than
that. The increase in the interest rate from 18% to 48%
within a period of four months is excessive.
[NOTE: In Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage
Bank v. Navarro, 15 SCRA 346(1987), the Supreme Court
disauthorized the bank from raising the interest rate on
the borrower’s loan from 12% to 17% despite an escalation
clause in the loan agreement signed by the debtors
authorizing Banco Filipino “to correspondingly increase the
interest rate stipulated in this contract without advance
notice to me/us in the event a law should be enacted
increasing the lawful rates of interest that may be charged
on this particular kind of loan.” The bank relied on Section
3 of Central Bank (Bangko Sentral) Circular 494, dated
July 1, 1976 (72 O.G. No. 3, p. 676-J) which provided that
“the maximum rate of interest, including commissions,
premiums, fees and other charges on loans with a maturity
of more than 730 days by banking institutions shall be
19%.” The Court disallowed the increase because “Circular
494, although it has the effect of law is not a law." The
Court held: “From March 17, 1980, escalation clauses, to be
581

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1309

<

valid, should specifically provide: (1) that there can be an
increase in interest if increased by law or by the Monetary
Board; and (2) in order for such stipulation to be valid, it
must include the provision for reduction of the stipulated
interest “in the event that the applicable maximum rate of
interest is reduced by law or by the Monetary Board.” In
the present case, the PNB relied on its own board resolution
and circulars but those resolution and circulars are neither
laws nor resolutions of the Monetary Board.]

(3) Exception to Inviolability of Contractual Obligations

Anucension v. National Labor Union
80 SCRA 350
The rule that the obligation of contracts should not be
impaired is not absolute. Thus, the free exercise of religious
beliefs is superior to contractual rights. An example is the
belief of a religious sect that its members should not join a labor
organization or participate in a collective bargaining agreement
Art 1309. The determination of the performance may
be left to a third person, whose decision shall not be binding
until it has been made known to both contracting parties.

will be up to the arbitrator. The only function of the Court in
this case would be to decide whether or not the parties should
proceed to arbitration. (Maguindanao Portland Cement Corp,
v. McDonough, GR 23390, April 24, 1967)
Art, 1310. The determination shall not be obligatory if it
evidently
inequitable. In such case, the courts shall decide
is
what is equitable under the circumstances.

COMMENT:
Evidently Inequitable Determination Is Not Rinding

What is equitable is a question of fact, to be ascertained
from the attendant circumstances.
(b) The court is called upon to decide what is equitable.

(a)

Art. 1311. Contracts take effect only between the parties,
their assigns and heirs, except in case where the rights and
obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible
by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law. The
heir is not liable beyond the value of the property he received
from the decedent.

If a contract should contain some stipulation in favor
of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment provided
he communicated his acceptance to the obligor before its
revocation. A mere incidental benefit or interest of a person
is not sufficient. The contracting parties must have clearly
and deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person.

The decision binds the parties only after it is made known

to both.

COMMENT:

(3) Effect of Stipulation Regarding Arbitration

If in a contract, there is a stipulation for arbitration (under
RA 875), and one party, in case of dispute, refuses to submit
the matter to arbitration, the aggrieved party who goes to court
to request it to order the other party to submit the matter to

This Article stresses the principle of RELATIVITY that
is, contracts are generally effective only between the PARTIES,
their ASSIGNS, and their HEIRS. (See Mamaril v. Boy Scouts

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1311

Quano v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 95900, July 23, 1992

It is a basic principle in civil law that, with certain

exceptions not obtaining in this case, a contract can only bind
the parties who had entered into it or their successors who
assumed their personalities or their juridical positions, and that,
as a consequence, such contract can neither favor nor prejudice

a third person.

The obligation of contracts is limited to the parties making
them and, ordinarily, only those who are parties to contracts
are liable for their breach. Parties to a contract cannot thereby
impose any liability on one who, under its terms, is a stranger
to the contract, and, in any event, in order to bind a third
person contractually, an expression of assent by such person is
necessary.

FGU Insurance Corp. v. G.P. Sarmiento Trucking
Corp. & Lambert M. Eroles
GR 141910, Aug. 6, 2002

FACTS: A truck driver was not a party to the contract of
carriage between petitioner’s principal and defendant.
ISSUE: May he be held liable under the agreement?
HELD: No, he may not be held liable. Respondent driver,
without concrete proof of his negligence or fault, may not
himself be ordered to pay petitioner. For a contract can only
bind the parties who have entered into it or their successors

who have assumed their personality or their juridical position.
Consonantly with the action res inter alios acta aus neque nocet
prodest, such contract can neither favor nor prejudice a third
person.

Petitioner’s civil action against thedriver can only be based
on culpa aquiliana, which, unlike culpa contractual, would
require the claimant for damages to prove negligence or fault on
the part of the defendant. (Calalas v. CA, 332 SCRA 356) (See

Siredy Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
and Conrado de Guzman
GR 129039, Sept. 17, 2002

FACTS: Private respondent Conrado de Guzman is an
architect-contractor doing business under the name and style of
Jigscon Construction. Herein petitioner Siredy Enterprises, Inc.
(SEI) is the owner and developer of Ysmael Village, a subdivision
in Sta. Cruz, Marilao in Bulacan. The president of SEI is Ismael
E. Yanga. As stated in its Articles of Incorporation, the primary
corporate purpose of SEI is to acquire lands, subdivide and
develop them, erect buildings and houses thereon, and sell, lease
or otherwise dispose of said properties to interested buyers.
Sometime before Oct. 1978, Yanga executed an undated
letter of Authority (LoA) authorizing Hermogenes B. Santos
to do and execute certain acts in representation of SEI. Thus,
on Oct. 15, 1978, Santos entered into a Deed of Agreement
with de Guzman. The deed expressly stated that Santos was
“representing SEI.” Private respondent was referred to as
“contractor” while petitioner SEI was cited as “principal.” From
Oct. 1978 to April 1990, de Guzman constructed 26 residential
units at Ysmael Village. Thirteen of these were fully paid but
the other 13 remained unpaid. The total contractual price of
these 13 unpaid houses is P412.154.93 which was verified and
confirmed to be correct by Santos, per an accomplishment Billing
that the latter signed. De Guzman tried but failed to collect the
unpaid account from petitioner. Thus, he instituted the action
in the RTC of Malolos, Bulacan for specific performance against
SEI, Yanga, and Santos who all denied liability. During the trial,
Santos disappeared and his whereabouts remain unknown.
In its defense, petitioner presented testimonial evidence
to the effect that SEI had no contract with De Guzman and had
not authorized Santos to enter into a contract with anyone for
the construction of housing units at Ysmael Village. The trial
court agreed with petitioner based on the doctrine of privity of
contract. On appeal, de Guzman obtained a favorable judgment
from the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA held that the LoA duly
signed by Yanga clearly constituted Santos as SEI’s agent, whose
authority included entering into a contract for the building of
housing units at Ysmael Village. Consequently, SEI cannot deny
liability for the Deed of Agreement with private respondent
585

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1311

de Guzman, since the same contract was entered into by SEFs
duly designated agent, Santos. There was no need for Yanga
himself to be a signatory to the contract, for him and SEI to
be bound by the terms thereof. Hence, the CA in reversing the
appealed decision rendered the following verdict: Appellee SEI
is ordered to pay appellant de Guzman’s costs and P412,154.93
as actual damages plus legal interest thereon from the filing
of the complaint on July 29, 1982 until full payment thereof.
All other claims and counterclaims are dismissed. Hence, this
petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of

Court.

ISSUES: (1) Whether or not Santos was a duly-constituted
agent of SEI, with authority to enter into contracts for the
construction of residential units in Ysmael Village and, thus, the
capacity to bind SEI to the Deed of Agreement; and (2) Assuming
arguendo that SEI was bound by the acts of Santos, whether or
not under the terms of the Deed of Agreement, SEI can be held
liable for the amount sought to be collected by private respondent
de Guzman.
HELD: (1) A valid agency was created between SEI and
Santos, and the authority conferred upon the latter includes the
power to enter into a construction contract to build houses such
as the Deed of Agreement between Santos and de Guzman’s
Jigscon Construction. Hence, the inescapable conclusion is that
SEI is bound by the contract through the representation of its
agent Santos.
(2) This matter is being raised for the first time on appeal.
From the trial in the RTC to the appeal before the CA, the alleged
violation of the Deed of Agreement by de Guzman was never put
in issue. Heretofore, the substance of petitioner’s defense before
the courts a quo consisted of its denial of any liability under the
Deed of Agreement. Thus, “a question that was never raised in
the courts below cannot be allowed to be raised for the first time
on appeal without offending basic rules of fair play, justice, and
due process. Such an issue was not brought to the fore either in
the trial court or the CA, and would have been disregarded by
the latter tribunal for the reasons previously stated. With more
reason, the same does not deserve consideration by this Court.
(Safic Alcan & Cie v. Imperial Vegetable Oil Co., Inc., 355 SCRA

559 [2001])

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1311

Petitioner SEI is ordered to pay de Guzman actual damages
in the amount of P4I2,154.93, with legal interest thereon from
the time the case was filed until its full payment.
(2) Exceptions to the Principle of Relativity
(a)

Where the obligations arising from the contract are not
transmissible by their NATURE, by STIPULATION, or
by PROVISION OF LAW. (Art. 1311, Civil Code)

(b)

Where there is a STIPULATION POUR AUTRUI (a
stipulation in favor of a third party). (Art. 1311, Civil Code)

(c)

Where a third person induces another to violate his
contract. (Art. 1314, Civil Code)

(d)

Where, in some cases, third persons may be adversely
affected by a contract where they did not participate. (See
Arts. 1312, 2150, 2151, Civil Code; Act 1956, the Insolvency
Law; and RA 875)

(e)

Where the law authorizes the creditor to sue on a contract
entered into by his debtor (“Accion Directa”).

(3) Discussion of the General Rule
(a)

“Contracts take effect only between the parties, their
assigns, and heirs” (Art. 1311, Civil Code), and, therefore,
generally, its terms cannot determine the rights of third
persons. (Bautista, et al. v. Judge Piguing, L-10006, Oct.

31, 1957; Phil. Nat. Bank v. Luzon Surety Co., Inc., L-1112,
May 28, 1958; and Nat. Labor Union v. Int. Oil Factory,
L-13845, May 30, 1960) The revocation, for example, of
a deed of sale is not conclusive on those individuals who
are not parties thereto. (Real Monasterio de la Purisima
Concepcion v. Domingo Fabian, et al., L-28470, Sept. 19,
1968) However, a person who takes advantage of a contract,
although he is NOT a signatory thereto, can properly be
bound by the terms thereof. He cannot take advantage of a
contract when it suits him to do so, and reject its provision
when he thinks otherwise. (Northern Motors, Inc. v. Prince
Line, L-13884, Feb. 29, 1960; and Cenon Villanueva v.
Barber-Wilhelmsen Line, et al., L-14764, Nov. 23, 1960)

El Hogar Filipino v. Angeles
L-11613, Sept. 30, 1958

FACTS: A was a stockholder in a mutual building
and loan association. Her shares matured in 1940, and
from that time, she ceased to be a stockholder, and instead
became its creditor for the value of her shares. At this point,
the officers and members of the Board of Directors entered
into an agreement with the Central Bank concerning the
revaluation of the shares.

Art. 1811

Strangers, therefore, cannot generally demand the
enforcement of a contract (Manila Railroad Co. v.
Compania Transatlantica, 38 Phil. 875); nor can they
demand its annulment (Ayson v. Court of Appeals, GR
L6501 and 6500; May 21, 1955); nor are they bound by
the same. (Celis v. Benedicto, O.G. March 6, 1941, p. 652
and 8 Manresa 630-631)

Manila Railroad Co. v. Compania Transatlantica
38 Phil. 875
FACTS: A shipped his cargo in B’s vessel. B and Cs
company entered into a contract for Cs company to unload
the cargo from the ship’s hold. In the lifting operations, A’s
cargo was damaged.
ISSUE: May A successfully sue Cs company for
damages?

HELD: No, for there was no contract between A and
Cs company. A’s remedy is to go against B.

ISSUE: Is A bound by the act of the Corporation
(Association)?

HELD: No, because at the time of agreement, she was
no longer a stockholder and, therefore, the officers and the
Board of Directors had lost their power to represent and
bind her in corporate transactions. The agreement does
not bind her unless she ratifies the agreement expressly
or impliedly.
[NOTE: In this case, it is clear that being a stranger
to the contract, she was not bound by it.)
[NOTE: A deed of assignment of property not
registered does not and cannot prejudice or favor strangers
to the agreement.]

who is not a party to said compromise (although) he may
have been a party to the action.
588

Celis v. Benedicto
O.G. March 6, 1941, p. 652
FACTS: A leased his property to B . B subleased part of
the premises to C. B violated the conditions of the lease, so
A wanted to rescind the lease contract. C objected because
if the lease is cancelled, the sublease would naturally be
affected.

ISSUE: Will Cs objection prosper?
HELD: No, because A is not bound by the sublease,
inasmuch as he did not participate therein.
House International Building Tenants
Association, Inc. v. IAC
GR 75287, June 30, 1987
FACTS: To secure payment of his obligation to the
GSIS, FA mortgaged a parcel of land and a 14-storey
building on said land. After the GSIS foreclosed the
mortgage and after it had consolidated ownership in
its name [i.e., after FA failed to redeem the property],
589

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1311

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the GSIS sold the property to CENTERTOWN under a
deed of conditional sale, without notice to the tenants of
the building and without securing prior clearance of the
Ministry of Human Settlements. Because CENTERTOWN
is not authorized to engage in real estate business, it
organized a sister corporation, TOWERS, to engage in
real estate business. Later, CENTERTOWN assigned to
TOWERS all its rights and obligations under the Deed of
Conditional Sale, with the consent and approval of the
GSIS.

The association of tenants of the building sued
CENTERTOWN, TOWERS, and GSIS for annulment of the
deed of conditional sale and the subsequent assignment of
the sale by CENTERTOWN to TOWERS, on the ground
that the sale is VOID ab initio because it is ultra vires, since
CENTERTOWN is not qualified to acquire real estate or
engage in real estate transactions, and also because “its
consideration is illicit” pursuant to Art. 1409.

HELD: The Tenant’s Association is neither a party
nor a privy to the Deed of Conditional Sale and the
assignment thereof. Hence, it cannot assail the validity
of said contracts. The interest one has in a given contract
determines the right of a party obligated principally or
subsidiarily to enable him to bring an action to nullify the
contract in which he intervenes. He who has no right in a
contract is not entitled to prosecute an action for nullity.
The person who is not a party to a contract or has no cause
of action or representation from those who intervened
therein has no right of action and personality so as to enable
him to assail the validity of the contract.
The main thrust of the Association’s challenge on
the validity of the conditional sale is that the contract
is ultra vires because CENTERTOWN is not qualified to
acquire properties under its articles of incorporation. The
Association has confused a void contract with an ultra vires
contract which is merely voidable.
Cited to support its assertion that the conditional
sale is against public policy are the provisions of the 1973
Constitution on eminent domain (Art. IV, Sec. 2; Art.
590

Art. 1811

XIV, Sec. 3), agrarian reform (Art. XIV, Sec. 12), and the
Declaration of Principles and State Policies, particularly
those emphasizing the “stewardship concept, under which
property is supposed to be held by the individual only as
trustee for the people in general, who are its real owners.”
(Art. II, Secs. 6 and 7) These constitutional provisions are
inapposite as bases for a declaration that the conditional
sale is null and void. Not one of these provisions renders
unlawful the contract in question. Except for the
prohibition against the taking of a private property for
public use without just compensation, the other provisions
require implementing legislation to confer a legal right and
impose a legal duty which can be judicially invoked.

Problem

S sold and delivered his property to B on credit. It
was agreed that B should not sell the property to another,
til after the price had been paid in full to S. Subsequently,
B sold the property to X although B has not yet paid fully
the price. May the sale ofX be cancelled on this ground?
ANS.: No, because X was not a party to the agreement
between S and B. S may, however, sue B for damages. (See
TS, Oct. 15, 1897 and 8 Manresa 630-631)

New Manila Lumber v. Republic
of the Philippines
L- 14248, April 28, 1960
FACTS: A lumber company sued the government
for the payment of certain materials obtained from it by
a contractor in connection with the construction of two
public school buildings. Incidentally, the government had
already a pending suit against said contractor for breach
of contract.
ISSUE: Will the suit of the lumber company prosper?

HELD: No, because the lumber company is not a
party to the contract between the government and the
contractor. Its remedy is to intervene in the case between
the government and the contractor, or to file an action in the
name of the Republic against the contractor on the latter’s

same should have been lodged with the Auditor General.
Indeed, the State cannot be sued without its consent.

GSIS v. Susana Romualdo, et al.
L-26170, Jan. 27, 1969
Intestate heirs who did not sign the deed of extrajudicial settlement (giving to one particular individual the
entire property) cannot be bound by said agreement — in
the absence of evidence that said non-signatory heirs had
given subsequently their conformity thereto.
(e) Heirs are bound to respect the contracts entered into by
their predecessors in interest (Art. 1311, Civil Code) in view
of their PRIVITY OF INTEREST with such predecessor.
(Galsinao v. Austria, GR L-7918, May 25, 1955) Therefore,
if the predecessor was duty-bound to reconvey land to
another, and at his death the reconveyance had not yet
been made, the heirs can be compelled to execute the proper
deed for reconveyance. (De Guzman v. Salak, GR L-4133,
May 13, 1952) The heirs, however, are not liable beyond
the value of the property they received from the decedent.
(Art. 1311, Civil Code)
(f) In order that an heir can question the validity of contracts
entered into by his predecessor, or bring an action to annul
the same, he must be a compulsory or forced heir, for the
simple reason that the deceased could do with the property
whatever he desired, as long as he respects the rights of
his compulsory or forced heirs. (Velarde, et al. v. Paez, et

sign the sale documents through the fraud, deceit, and
misrepresentation of the defendants.

ISSUE: Did the plaintiffs have the legal capacity to
question the validity of the deeds of sale?

HELD: No, because they are not compulsory heirs.
Moreover, they were neither principally nor subsidiarily
bound by the contracts of sale. In the instant case, the
decedent could dispose of her estate without any limitations
except those imposed by law. It cannot be said that their
legitimes were impaired, for they are not compulsory heirs,
and are, therefore, not entitled to any legitime.

ANS.:

— YES.

(Velarde v. Paez, supra)

—

if they were illicit or illegal
NO, because even
the deceased had no right to question them herself,
and had no right to recover the properties illicitly
conveyed. HOWEVER, an action to RESCIND the
contract can prosper, insofar as the legitimes of the
compulsory heirs are prejudiced, under Art. 1381(3) of
the Civil Code (which refers to the right of creditors to
rescind contracts in fraud of their rights), because the
right to the legitime is similar to a credit of a creditor,
insofar as the right to the legitime may be defeated
by such transaction. ( Concepcion v. Sta. Ana, L-2277,
Dec. 29, 1950)
(NOTE: In the Velarde v. Paez case, neither
the remedy of annulment nor of rescission could be
availed of for the simple reason that the heirs in said
case were not compulsory heirs.)

Rights of the predecessor may be transmitted to the heirs
provided they are not intransmissible.

Stipulation Pour Autrui

Codal Provision
“If a contract should contain some
stipulation in favor of a third party, he may demand its
fulfillment provided he communicated his acceptance to the
obligor before its revocation (the revocation of the whole
contract itself or of the stipulation alone). The contracting
parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor
upon a third person. A mere incidental benefit or interest
of a person is not sufficient.” (Art. 1311, second par.)

Requisites:
1)

There must be a stipulation in favor of a third person.

2)

The contracting parties must have clearly and
deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person.

3)

A mere incidental benefit or interest of a person is
NOT sufficient. (See Uy Tam v. Leonard, 30 Phil. 471)

4)

The stipulation must be PART of the contract.

5)

The third person communicated his acceptance to
the obligor before its revocation (revocation of the
contract or the stipulation by the original parties)(See
Kauffman v. Phil. Nat. Bank, 42 Phil. 182); acceptance
may be in the form of a DEMAND. (Ibid.)
594

6)

Art. 1311

There must be no relation of agency between either
of the parties and the third person. (8 Manresa 632)

Definition of a Stipulation Pour Autrui:

It is a stipulation in favor of a third person conferring a
clear and deliberate favor upon him, and which stipulation
is merely part of a contract entered into by the parties,
neither of whom acted as agent of the third person.

Rebecca C. Young, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 79518, Jan. 13, 1989

The requisites of a stipulation pour autrui or a
stipulation in favor of a third person are the following:
(1)

There must be a stipulation in favor of a third

person.
(2) The stipulation must be a part, not the whole,
of the contract.
(3) The contracting parties must have clearly and
deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person, not a
mere incidental benefit or interest.

(4) The third person must have communicated his
acceptance to the obligor before its revocation.
(5) Neither of the contracting parties bears the legal
representation or authorization of the third party.

[NOTE: Such a stipulation is binding on said third
person, although he may not be a signatory to the contract.

also agreed that only P8,000,000 would be given to C,

X, a creditor of C. If X communicates his acceptance of the
stipulation to D, X can demand its fulfillment.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: The heirs can recover indemnity from the
Insurance Company because of the following reasons:
1)

While in general only parties to a contract can sue
on an action based thereon, one exception is in the
case of a stipulation pour autrui. In this insurance
case, there clearly is a benefit conferred directly in
favor of the passengers and the authorized driver (or
their heirs). Hence, the heirs can sue. (See Uy Tan v.
Leonard, 30 Phil. 471; and Kauffman v. Philippine
National Bank, 42 Phil. 182) The heirs indeed have
a proper cause of action, even without joining the
insured Taxi Co. (See Guingon v. Capital Insurance
& Surety Co., L-22042, Aug. 17, 1967)

2)

Since neither party during the negotiations preceding
the institution of the case invoked the reference to
arbitration, this omission has the effect of a WAIVER
of their respective rights to demand an arbitration.

Melecio Coquia, et al. v. Fieldmen’s Ins. Co., Inc.
L-23278, Nov. 29, 19«8
FACTS: The Manila Yellow Taxicab Co. obtained
a common carrier accident insurance policy from the
Fieldmen’s Insurance Co. Under the terms of the policy, the
Insurance agreed to indemnify any fare-paying passenger,
including the authorized driver, driving the taxi at the
time of the accident. In the event of death, the personal
representatives would be given the indemnity. The contract
likewise provides that before suit could be brought, the
matter will first be decided by arbitrators.

Now then, while the policy was in force (Feb. 10,
1962) a taxi of the Insured, driven by duly-authorized

driver, Carlito Coquia, met an accident where Carlito died.
Although neither party sought to have the matter settled
by arbitrators, Coquia’s heirs sought indemnity in a judicial
action against the Insurance Company. The latter alleges

that:
1)

the heirs have no contractual relations with the
company;

2)

the Insured has not complied with the contractual
provisions on arbitration.

Kauffman v. Phil. Nat. Rank
42 Phil. 182

FACTS: The Philippine Fiber and Produce Company,
for some consideration, contracted with the Philippine Nat.
Bank. One of the stipulations was for the bank to order its
representative in New York to give a certain sum of money
to Mr. Kauffman, who was President of the Phil. Fiber and
Produce Company. After the order was given, the New York
representative suggested that the money be withheld from
Mr. Kauffman in view of the latter’s reluctance to pay for
some company debts. The Manila office then told the New
York representative to WITHHOLD said money. Later, Mr.
Kauffman demanded payment, and when this was refused,

ISSUE: Is Kauffman entitled to the amount?
HELD- Yes, because this is a clear case of a stipulation
pour autrui. The demand for payment constituted an
acceptance of the stipulation. It cannot be said that

such incidental stipulation occurs when a surety company
executes a bond in favor of the City of Manila to guarantee
a construction company's building transaction, and states
incidentally in the bond that it shall promptly make all
payments to labor and materialmen. Here, the labor and
materialmen cannot sue on the basis of the bond, even if
they had previously made known their acceptance of such
stipulation. (Uy Tam v. Leonard, 30 Phil. 471) (Here, the
Court said that from the language of the bond, it was clear
that the creditor was the City of Manila, and that it was
never intended by the surety company that it would be
bound to the labor and materialmen in case of non-payment
to them.)

there had been a PRIOR revocation of the stipulation, for
while it is true that the Bank had ordered its New Yorii
representative to withhold payment, still the revocation
referred to in the law is a revocation by BOTH parties to
the original contract.

A stipulation pour autri need not be in any particular
form, and may even be inferred from the fact that the
beneficiary has enjoyed the same for a considerable period.

Northern Motors, Inc. v. Prince Line, et al.
L-13884, Feb. 29, 1960

FACTS: The Delgado Brothers, Inc. was the arrastre
contractor for Manila in charge of unloading and delivering
cargo. In its contract with the Bureau of Customs, it
generally limited its liability to P500 for each package lost.
ISSUE: If a consignee (3rd person) takes advantage
of this service, is it bound by the limited liability?
HELD: Yes, because of its “acceptance.”

Cronico v. J.M. Tuason & Co^ Inc.
L-35272, Aug. 26, 1977
A stipulation pour autrui is for the benefit of somebody
who is not a party to a contract. If the stipulation states
that one of the parties to a contract is exempt from all
previous claims and damages sustained by the other party,
the stipulation is not pour autrui.

If the stipulation be merely incidental, it is not the
stipulation pour autrui referred to in the law. An example of

The acceptance of the stipulation by the third party may
be made expressly or implicitly, formally or informally.

44 Phil. 169
FACTS: A promised B that if B’s daughter would serve
him (A) in his house, A would give to said daughter some
of his properties if and when she decided to get married to
the man of her choice. Subsequently, the daughter rendered
services to A in his house.
ISSUE: Is there acceptance of the stipulation by a
third party?
HELD: Yes, for the rendition of the services can be
considered an implied acceptance of the stipulation.
If the principal contract of which the stipulation forms part
is void, the stipulation is generally also void. If because of
vitiated consent, the principal contract is annulled, the
stipulation also ceased to be effective.
Any party as well as the beneficiary of the stipulation.

where the lessor can sue the sub-lessee.) (Art. 1652, Civil
Code) Moreover, “without prejudice to his obligation toward
the sub-lessor, the sub-lessee is bound to the lessor for all
acts which refer to the use and preservation of the thing
leased in the manner stipulated between the lessor and
the lessee.” (Art. 1651, Civil Code)
(b) Another example is that given under Art. 1729 of the
Civil Code which states: “Those who put their labor upon
or furnish materials for a piece of work undertaking by
the contractor have an action against the owner up to the
amount owing from the latter to the contractor at the time
claim is made. However, the following shall not prejudice
the laborers, employees, and furnishers of materials:

Other instances where strangers may be adversely affected
are the following:
1)

In the quasi-contract of ‘negotiorum gestio* some
contracts entered into by the unauthorized manager
(gestor) may bind the owner. (See Arts. 2150-2151,
Civil Code)

2)

In a contract which creates a status, the whole world
must respect such status. (Thus, when X marries
Y, the whole world must realize that the marriage

wife would not result in the commission of adultery.)

A leased his land to B. The lease right was duly

A house owner, even if he did not participate
therein, is bound by the contracts entered into
between contractors on the one hand, and laborers or
materialmen on the other hand, such that the owner
may be held liable for payment by such laborers or
materialmen. This is an exception to the rule on

(9) ‘Lack of Privity of Contract’

Associated Bank v. CA
208 SCRA 465
(1992)

In the case at bar, the Supreme Court held that the person
who suffered the loss as a result of the unauthorized encash¬
ment of crossed checks was allowed to recover the loss directly
from the negligent bank despite the latter’s contention of lack
of privity of contract.
[NOTE: A peculiar circumstance in Associated Bank v. CA
(208 SCRA 465 [1992]), is the fact that the drawer companies,

which should have been directly liable to the aggrieved payer,
were not impleaded as parties in the suit. (BDO Unibank, Inc
v. Lao, 827 SCRA 481 [2017])]
(10) Relativity of Contracts as Applied

The basic principle of relativity of contracts is that, as a
general rule, contracts take effect only between the parties, their
assigns, and heirs. (Virata v. Ng Wee, 830 SCRA 271 [2017])
Thus, the Supreme Court in Power Sector Assets and
Liabilities Management Corp, or PSALM v. CA (817 SCRA 551
[2017]), had occasion to say

-

“[w]hatever rights and obligations arising from [the] con¬
tract between the National Power Corp. (NPC) and [the]
San Miguel Protective Security Agency (SMPSA) did not
affect [the] PSALM under the basic principle of relativity
of contract by which contracts take effect only between the
parties, their assigns, and heirs.”

Art. 1312. In contracts creating real rights, third persons
who come into possession of the object of the contract are
bound thereby, subject to the provisions of the Mortgage Law
and the Land Registration Laws.

COMMENT.
(1) Contracts Creating Real Rights
This Article constitutes one of the exceptions to the general
rule that a contract binds only the parties.
602

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1313-1314

(2) Reason for the Article

A real right binds the property over which it is exercised.
(3) Example

If A should purchase an apartment house from the owner
but there is a lease thereon, A must respect the lease, if the
same is registered in the Registry of Property, or if A has actual
knowledge of the existence and duration of the lease. Similarly,
the purchaser of land must respect a mortgage constituted
thereon, under the same circumstances given hereinabove.

Art. 1313. Creditors are protected in cases of contracts
intended to defraud them.

COMMENT:
(1) Right of Defrauded Creditors

This Article represents another instance when an outsider
can in a sense interfere with smother’s contract.
(2) Example

If A gratuitously gives B a parcel of land, and A has no other
property or cash left to satisfy his creditors, said creditors may
ask for the rescission of the contract, to the extent that they have
been prejudiced. (See Arts. 1177, 1381, and 1387, Civil Code)

Art. 1314. Any third person who induces another to
violate his contract shall be liable for damages to the other
contracting party.

COMMENT:
(1) Rule If Contract Is Violated Through Inducement of Third

Person
This Article gives an instance when a stranger to a contract
can be sued in view of his unwarranted interference. Whoever
is injured may properly sue for damages. (Gilchrist v. Cuddy,

arise ex-contractu for he was not a party to the contract. (See
Daywait v. Corporation, 39 Phil. 587)]
[NOTE: In the same example, F cannot be held liable for
greater damages than S. A contrary answer would “lead to result
at once grotesque and unjust.” (Daywait v. Corporation, 39 Phil.

at most, be solidary with S because of his commission of a tort.

(3) Case

Yu v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 86683, Jan. 21, 1993
FACTS: Petitioner, the exclusive distributor of the House
of Mayfair wall-covering products in the Philippines, cried
foul when his former dealer of the same goods, herein private
respondent, purchased the merchandise from the House of
Mayfair in England through FNP Trading in West Germany
and sold said merchandise in the Philippines. Both the court of
origin and the appellate court rejected petitioner’s thesis that
private respondent was engaged in a sinister form of unfair
competition within the context of Art. 28 of the Civil Code.
In the suit for injunction which petitioner filed before
the RTC-NCR stationed in Manila, petitioner pressed the idea
that he was practically by-passed and that private respondent
acted in concert with the FNP Trading in misleading Mayfair
into believing that the goods ordered by the trading firm were
intended for shipment to Nigeria although they were actually
shipped to and sold in the Philippines. Private respondent
professed ignorance of the exclusive contract in favor of
petitioner. Even then, private respondent responded by asserting
that petitioner’s understanding with Mayfair is binding only

between the parties thereto.

604

overlooked was petitioner’s suggestion, which was not disputed
by herein private respondent in its comment, that the House
of Mayfair in England was duped into believing that the
goods ordered through the FNP Trading were to be shipped to
Nigeria only, but the goods were actually sent to and sold in the
Philippines.

HELD: A ploy of this character is akin to the scenario
of a third person who induces a party to renege on or violate
his undertaking under a contract, thereby entitling the other
contracting party to relief therefrom. (Art. 1314, Civil Code) The
breach caused by private respondent was even aggravated by
the consequent diversion of trade from the business of petitioner
to that of private respondent caused by the latter’s species of
unfair competition, as demonstrated no less by the sales effected
inspite of this Court’s restraining order.

This brings us to the irreparable mischief which res¬
pondent court misappreciated when it refused to grant the
relief simply because of the observation that petitioner can be
fully compensated for the damage. A contrario, the injury is
irreparable where it is continuous and repeated since from its
constant and frequent recurrence, no fair and reasonable redress
ran be had therefor by petitioner insofar as his goodwill and
business reputation as sole distributor are concerned. Withal,
to expect petitioner to file a complaint for every sale effected by
private respondent will certainly court multiplicity of suits.
Art. 1315. Contracts are perfected by mere consent,
and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the
fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to
all the consequences which, according to their nature, may
be in keeping with good faith, usage, and law.

COMMENT:
(1) Consensuality of Contracts

The Article stresses the CONSENSUALITY OF
CONTRACTS (or perfection by mere consent).

(3) Perfection of Consensual Contracts

Consensual contracts are perfected from the moment there
is agreement (consent) on the subject matter, and the cause or

FACTS: From March 16, 1990 to April 3, 1990, petitioner
had more than two weeks to accept the offer of respondent.
Although petitioner avers that he had accepted the offer of
respondent on March 28, 1990, however, he failed to transmit to
respondent the copy of the March 14, 1990 letter-offer bearing
his conformity thereto.

consideration.

HELD: Unless and until the respondent received said copy
of the letter-offer, it cannot be argued that a contract had already
been perfected between petitioner and respondent.

When a contract to purchase from the Reparations
Commission is still subject to a series of tedious steps such as
the conclusion of an annual procurement program, the obtaining
of authority from a higher office (like the Philippine Reparations
Mission in Japan), and the stipulating of what the rate of
exchange should be, there is as yet no perfected contract of sale.

A contract is perfected only from the time an acceptance
of an offer is made known to the offeror. An offer made inter
praesentes must be accepted immediately. If the parties intended
that there should be an express acceptance, the contract will
be perfected only upon knowledge by the offeror of the express
acceptance by the offeree of the offer. An acceptance which is not
made in the manner prescribed by the offeror is not effective but
constitutes a counter-offer which the offeror may accept or reject.
The contract is not perfected if the offeror revokes or withdraws
its offer and the revocation or withdrawal of the offeror is the
first to reach the offeree. The acceptance by the offeree of the
offer after knowledge of the revocation or withdrawal of the offer
is inefficacious.
(2) How Contracts Are Perfected

—

consensual contracts by mere consent (this is the general
rule) (Art. 1315). (Example: contract of sale). (Art. 1315)
(b) real contracts
perfected by delivery (Examples: deposit
and pledge). (Art. 1316, Civil Code)
(c) formal or solemn contracts here a special form is required
for perfection (Example: A simple donation inter vivos of
real property, to be valid and perfected, must be in a public
instrument) . (Art. 749, Civil Code) [NOTE: To be a written
contract, all its terms must be in writing, so that a contract
partly in writing and partly oral is, in legal effect, an oral
contract. (Manuel v. Rodriguez, et al., L-13435, July 26,

(4) Consequences of Perfection
(a)

The parties are bound to the fulfillment of what has been
EXPRESSLY STIPULATED (Art. 1315, Civil Code), and
compliance thereof must be in GOOD FAITH. (Art. 1159,
Civil Code)
[NOTE: If the true intention is not expressed in a
written agreement, in case one has been made, the proper
remedy is REFORMATION. (Art. 1359, Civil Code)]

The parties are ALSO bound to all the CONSEQUENCES
which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with
GOOD FAITH, USAGE, and LAW.

L-11744, May 28, 1958
FACTS: The Armed Forces of the Philippines
occupied a parcel of land belonging to Vda. de Murciano.
To indemnify her for this occupancy, the Office of the Chief
of Engineers forwarded to her for her signature a quit¬
claim agreement whereby she was to be paid the amount
of P15,067.31 as complete payment. Plaintiff signed said
agreement on April 4, 1951, and returned the same to
the Office of Engineers. Before it could be signed by the
Commanding Officers of the Philippine Service Command

Art 1315

in representation of the Republic, the armed forces was
reorganized, and the Chief of Staff refused to sign it on
the ground that the woman was entitled to only P7.000.
ISSUE: Is the Armed Forces liable for the first
amount of P15,067.31?
HELD: Yes, for the contract was perfected from the
time the Armed Forces received the woman’s acceptance
of its offer. The refusal of the Chief of Staff does not in the
least affect her right to ask for fulfillment of the perfected
agreement. The absence of a writing does not preclude the
binding effect of the contract duly perfected by a meeting
of the minds, the contract not being of the class called
“formal” or “solemn.”

Vicente & Michael Lun v. Court of Appeals
& Liberty H. Luna
GR 118347, Oct. 24, 1996
75 SCAD 574
Private respondent fails to distinguish between
condition imposed on the perfection of the contract and
a condition imposed on the performance of an obligation.
Failure to comply with the first condition results in the
failure of a contract, while failure to comply with the second
condition only gives the other party the option either to
refuse to proceed with the sale or to waive the condition.
Indeed, private respondent is not the injured party.
She cannot rescind the contract without violating the
principle of mutuality of contracts, which prohibits allowing
the validity and performance of contracts to be left to the
will of one of the parties.
(5) What the Buyer Should Have Made

As the Supreme Court held in Unai v. CA (473 SCRA 52
[2005]), the perfected contract to sell imposed on the buyer the
obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price.

Such being the case, the buyer should have made the
proper tender of payment and consignation of the price in court
as required by law. (Felix Plaza Urban Poor Settlers Community
Association, Inc. u. Lipat, Sr., 821 SCRA 12 {2017})

Perfected Contract

Orbe v. Filinvest Land, Inc.
839 SCRA 72
(2017)

In a great number of cases, the sellers of real property shall
be juridical persons acting through representatives.
In these cases, it is imperative that the officer signing for
the seller indicate that he or she is duly authorized to effect the
cancellation of an otherwise perfected contract.
Art. 1316. Real contracts, such as deposit, pledge and
commodatum, are not perfected until the delivery of the object
of the obligation.

COMMENT:
(1) Perfection of Real Contracts

Real contracts require consent, subject matter, cause or
consideration, and DELIVERY.
(2) Delivery as a Requisite

Delivery is required of the very nature of the contract. (8
Manresa 637) For example, a depositary cannot be expected to

comply with his obligation of keeping the object safely unless
and until it is delivered to him.
(3) The Real Contracts Referred to

The real contracts referred to in Art. 1316 are:
DEPOSIT
(b) PLEDGE
(c) COMMODATUM, a loan where the identical object must
be returned (Example: Loan of a car)
(a)

(4) Future Real Contracts as Consensual Contracts

A contract “to make a deposit, to make a pledge, or to make
a commodatum” is a consensual contract. After delivery, the
contract becomes a real contract.

Art. 1317

Example: A agreed to lend B his (A’s) car on Sept. 8. If on
Sept. 8 A refuses to deliver the car, may B sue him for damages?
ANS.: Yes, because of the consensual contract of “to make
a commodatum.” If A had delivered the car and B through
negligence damages the car, A can sue him because of the real
contract of “commodatum.”
[NOTE: Similarly, “an agreement (consensual) to constitute
a deposit is binding, but the deposit itself (the real contract of
deposit) is not perfected until the delivery of the thing.” (Art.
1963, Civil Code)]

COMMENT:
(1) Requisite for a Person to Contract in the Name of Another

The contract “to carry” (at some future time) is consensual
and is perfected by mere consent.

(b)

The contract of “carriage” is a real contract, for not until
the carrier is actually used can we consider the contract
perfected, that is, ‘til the moment of actual use, the carrier
cannot be said to have already assumed the obligation of
a carrier.

UNENFORCEABLE CONTRACT) CONTRACT
In Jose’s name, but without Jose’s authorization, Maria
sold Jose’s car to Marilyn. The sale of the car is unauthorized.
[NOTE: In the example given, mere lapse of time cannot
cure the defect; this is not the ratification required by the law.
(Tipton v. Velasco, 6 Phil. 67)]

[NOTE: The real contract of carriage is perfected even
if the passenger has not yet paid, in fact, even if he has no
money for his fare. (See Barker v. Ohio River R. Co., 51 W.

Va. 423) It does not even matter that he has not boarded the
vehicle completely. The all-important fact is that he has,
with the express or implied consent of the carrier, placed
a part of his body, or a portion of the goods on any part of
the jeepney, taxi or bus, such as the stepping platform or
the running board. (See Illinois C. R. Co. v. O'Keefe, 68 III.

[NOTE: The death of the principal does NOT render the act
of an agent unenforceable, where the agent had no knowledge of
such extinguishment of the agency. (Herrera, et al. v. Luy Kim

Art. 1317. No one may contract in the name of another
without being authorized by the latter, or unless he has by
law a right to represent him.
A contract entered into in the name of another by one
who has no authority or legal representation, or who has acted
beyond his powers, shall be unenforceable, unless it is ratified,
expressly or impliedly, by the person on whose behalf it has
been executed, before it is revoked by the other contracting

Badillo v. Ferrer
GR 51369, July 29, 1987

,,

FACTS: Macario died intestate in 1966, survived by his
widow, Clarita, and five minor children. He left a parcel of land.
In 1967, Clarita, in her own behalf and as natural guardian of
the minor plaintiffs, executed a deed of extrajudicial partition
and sale of the property through which she sold the property
611

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1317

to Gregorio. In 1968, Modesta, a sister of Macario, was able
to obtain guardianship over the property and persons of the
minor children. In 1970, the guardian caused the minor children
to file a complaint to annul the sale of their participation in
the property and asked that as co-owners they be allowed to
exercise the right of legal redemption with respect to Clarita’s
participation therein. The trial court annulled the sale to
Gregorio of the minor children’s participation in the property
and allowed them to redeem the participation of their mother
therein.
HELD: The Supreme Court sustained the annulment of
the sale with respect to the children’s participation. The deed
of extrajudicial partition is unenforceable, or more specifically,
an unauthorized contract under Arts. 1403[l] and 1317 of the
New Civil Code. Clarita has no authority, i.e., she acted beyond
her powers in conveying to Gregorio the undivided share of her
minor children in the property. The powers given to her by the
law as the natural guardian cover only matters of administration
and cannot include the power of disposition. The children never
ratified the deed of partition and sale. Hence, the contract
remained unenforceable or unauthorized. No restitution may be
ordered from the minors either as to that portion of the purchase
price which pertains to their share in the property or at least as
to that portion which benefited them because the law does not
sanction any.
(3) Implied Ratification

Ratification can be implied from acts, such as when the
owner of a hacienda which was sold to strangers without his
authority, collected the amount in a promissory note given as
purchase price (Tacalinar v. Corro, 34 Phil. 898), or when the
Board of Directors of a private corporation should take advantage
of the benefits derived from an authorized contract entered into
by its President. The Corporation is thus bound even without a
formal resolution on the matter. (Buenaseda u. Bowen and Co.,
Inc., et al., L-14985, Dec. 29, 1960)
(4) Effect of Ratification

Ratification cleanses the contract from all its defects from
the moment the contract was entered into. (Art. 1396, Civil Code)
612

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1317

Hence, there is a retroactive effect. (Tacalinar v. Corro, 34 Phil

898)

[NOTE: There can be no more ratification if the contract
has previously been REVOKED by the other contracting party.
(Art. 1317, par. 2)]
(5) Effect When an Unauthorized Person Does Not Really

Need the Authority

If a lawyer, without his client’s authority, signs a
compromise0 contract (which is not really a compromise for
what were stipulated were only rights and obligations provided
for by law
and hence no reciprocal concession was really
involved). The contract would bind the client, not because of
the “compromise” but because of the legal provisions involved.

co-owned, pro-indiviso, by petitioner Emilia together with her
petitioner-son Benjamin, and her two other sons, Catalino and
Ceferino. No proof was presented to show that the co-ownership
that existed among the heirs of Ceferino and Catalino and herein
petitioners has ever been terminated.
Applying Arts. 1317 and 1403, respectively, the Court of
Appeals ruled that through their inaction and silence, the three
sons of Emilia are considered to have ratified the aforesaid sale
of the subject property by their mother.
613

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1317

HELD: The Supreme Court disagrees with the appellate
court, ruling that the three sons of Emilia did not ratify the sale.
Unaware of such sale, Catalino, Ceferino, and Benjamin could
not be considered as having voluntarily remained silent and
knowingly chose not to file an action for the annulment of the
sale. Their alleged silence and inaction may not be interpreted
as an act of ratification on their part.
Ratification means that one under no disability voluntarily
adopts and gives sanction to some unauthorized act or defective
proceeding, which without his sanction would not be binding on
him. It is this voluntary choice, knowingly made, which amounts
to a ratification of what was, therefore, unauthorized, and be¬
comes the authorized act of the party so making the ratification.

Chapter 2

ESSENTIAL REQUISITES OF CONTRACTS
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Art. 1318. There is no contract unless the following
requisites concur:
Consent of the contracting parties;
(2) Object certain which is the subject matter of the
contract;
(3) Cause of the obligation which is established.

COMMENT:
(1) Essential Requisites of Consensual Contracts

The three essential requisites for consensual contracts are
enumerated in this Article.
[NOTE: Under the old Civil Code, “consideration” was the
word used instead of “cause of the obligation.”]
(2) Real Contracts

Real contracts require a fourth requisite
(3) Solemn or Formal Contracts

—

DELIVERY.

—

Solemn or formal contracts require a fourth requisite
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FORMALITIES REQUIRED BY
LAW. (Example: A simple donation inter vivos of land requires
a public instrument for its perfection.)
(4) What Consent Presupposes

Consent presupposes legal capacity (8 Manresa 646) and
the fulfillment of conditions, should any be attached. (Ruperto
v. Kosca, 26 Phil. 227)
614

615

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1318

(5) Effect of Noii-consent
(a)

If there is absolutely no consent (as in the case of a JOKE),
there is no contract. The agreement may be considered
inexistent or non-existent or VOID. (The same rule applies
in the case of absolutely simulated contract, one where the
parties never intended to be bound.)

(b)

If there is a vice of consent (vitiated consent) such as error,
fraud, or undue influence, etc., the contract is not void; it
is merely voidable.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1319

One of the three essential requisites of a valid contract is
consent of the parties on the object and cause of the contract. In
a contract of sale, the parties must agree not only on the price,
but also on the manner of payment of the price. An agreement on
the price but a disagreement on the manner of its payment will
not result in consent, thus, preventing the existence of a valid
contract for lack of consent. This lack of consent is separate and
distinct from lack of consideration where the contract states that
the price has been paid when in fact, it has never been paid.
Section 1

(6) Transportation Ticket as a Contract

CONSENT

Peralta de Guerrero, et al. v. Madrigal Shipping Co.
L-12951, Nov. 17, 1959
A transportation ticket is a complete written contract
between the shipper and the passenger since it has all the
elements of a complete contract: (a) the consent of the contracting
parties manifested by the fact that the passenger boards the
ship and the shipper consents or accepts him in the ship for
transportation; (b) cause or consideration, which is the fare paid
by the passenger, as stated in the ticket; and (c) object, which is
the transportation of the passenger from the place of departure
to the place of destination as stated in the ticket.

Art. 1319. Consent is manifested by the meeting of the
offer and the acceptance upon the thing and the cause which
are to constitute the contract. The offer must be certain and
the acceptance absolute. A qualified acceptance constitutes
a counter-offer.
Acceptance made by letter or telegram does not bind the
offerer except from the time it came to his knowledge. The
contract, in such a case, is presumed to have been entered
into in the place where the offer was made.

(7) Lack of Consent Is Separate and Distinct from Lack of

This Article emphasizes CONSENT, which is the first
essential requisite of every contract.

Consideration

Rido Montecillo v. Ignacia Reynes & Spaires
Redemptor & Elisa Abucay
GR 138018, July 26, 2002
The manner of payment of the purchase price is an essential
element before a valid and binding contract of sale can exist.
Although the Civil Code does not expressly state that the minds
of the parties must also meet on the terms or manner of payment
of the price, the same is needed, otherwise there is no sale.
Agreement on the manner of payment goes into the price such
that a disagreement on the manner of payment is tantamount
to a failure to agree on the price. (Toyota Shaw, Inc. v. CA, 244
SCRA 320 [1995])
616

COMMENT:
(1) Consent as an Essential Requisite

(2) ‘Consent’ Defined

It is the meeting of the minds between the parties on the
subject matter and the cause of the contract, even if neither
one has been delivered.
(b) It is the manifestation of the meeting of the offer and the
acceptance upon the thing and the cause which are to
constitute the contract. (Art. 1319, 1st par.)

(a)

Example:

A offered to sell B a particular car for P2,000,000.
Before B could consent, A withdrew the offer. Was A
allowed to do so?
617

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1319

minds yet, hence no contract had been perfected.

interests involved. (See Art. 1490, Civil Code; Garchitorena
v. Sotelo, 74 Phil. 25)]
(b)

The parties must be capable or capacitated (hence, if one
party be insane, the contract is merely voidable).

(c)

There must be no vitiation of consent.
(Example: There must be no fraud or intimidation,
otherwise the contract is voidable.)

(d)

There must be no conflict between what was expressly
declared and what was really intended. Otherwise, the
remedy may be reformation, as when the parties really
intended to be bound, or else the contract is VOID, as when
the contract is fictitious or absolutely simulated.)

(e)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The intent must be declared properly (that is, whatever
legal formalities are required must be complied with).

Roberto Escay, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.
L-37504, Dec. 18, 1974
Conformity to an original contract generally
presupposes conformity to a subsequent contract executed
precisely to cure a defect in the original contract (such
as the failure to state the cause or consideration of said
original contract).

LCC Corporation v. Farrales
L-39804, April 17, 1984
If a person does not enter into a contract for delivery
of certain articles, he cannot be held responsible for the
non-payment of the goods. After all, there is no privity of
contract referred to in the problem.
618

(5) An Offer That Is CERTAIN

In order that an offer can be considered CERTAIN, it
must not be vague, misleading, or made as a joke. Therefore, a
declaration of a person of “his intention to enter into a contract”
is not an offer that is CERTAIN. (Rosenstock v. Burke, 46 Phil.
217) If the offer is withdrawn before it is accepted, there is no
meeting of the minds. (Jose Benares, et al. v. Capitol Subdivision,
Inc., L-7330, Nov. 29, 1960)

Rosenstock v. Burke
46 Phil. 217

FACTS: A letter began as follows: “In connection with the
yacht Bronzewing, I am in position and am willing to entertain
the purchase of it under the following terms.”
ISSUE: Was there an offer here that was certain, an offer
which, if accepted, could compel the writer to really buy the
yacht?
HELD: No, because here the offer was neither definite
nor certain. Said the Supreme Court: “To convey the idea of
a resolution to purchase, a man of ordinary intelligence and
common culture would use these clear and simple words: ‘I offer
to purchase,’ T want to purchase,' T am in position to purchase.
. .’ It must be presumed that a man in his transactions in
good faith used the best means of expressing his mind that his
intelligence and culture so permit as to convey and exteriorize his
will faithfully and unequivocally. The word ‘entertain’ applied
to an act does not mean the resolution to perform said act, but
simply a position to deliberate for deciding to perform said act.
It was not a definite or certain offer, but a mere invitation to a
proposal being made to him, which might be accepted by him
or not.”

.

619

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1319

[NOTE: If two contracts are offered, but they are
independent of each other (such as a sale of a parcel of land,
and the lease of an automobile), acceptance of one does not
imply acceptance of the other. BUT if one contract depends
upon another, like a contract of loan provided it is secured by a
contract of mortgage, it is essential that there be an agreement
on BOTH transactions. Otherwise, there can be as yet no meeting
of the minds. (See 8 Manresa 652)]

Venturanza and Price v. Canizares, et cd.
L-13396, Oct. 22, 1958

If an offer is made to buy property at a certain price but “in
the event that the bid of any other offerer shall be considered
to be the best in terms of the amount offered and the conditions
stipulated therein,” the offerer is “willing and agreeable to
equal or to improve the said “best offer’ by adding another
certain amount,” it cannot be denied that the amount offered
is speculative and not a definite offer which is definite and not
speculative.
Consolidated Mills, Inc. v. Reparations Commission
76 SCRA 18

Before the completion of the steps for the purchase of
reparation goods, any agreement between the Reparations
Commission and the end-user is thereby a simple preliminary
transaction that has no obligatory effect. The agreement becomes
complete when the procurement of the goods in behalf of the
end-user becomes absolutely certain with the availability of the
reparation goods.
(6) An Acceptance That Is UNQUALLELED and ABSOLUTE

(a)

If there is completely no acceptance or if the offer is
expressly rejected, there is no meeting of the minds.
(Leoquinco v. Postal Savings Bank, 47 Phil. 772 and
Gamboa v. Gonzales, 17 Phil. 381) If the acceptance be
qualified or not absolute, there is no concurrence of minds.
There merely is a counter-offer. (Batangan v. Cojuangco, 78
Phil. 481 and Art. 1391, Civil Code) If one promises to act
as surety for another’s obligation as an agent, he does not

answer for the latter’s obligation as a purchaser. (Pacific
Tobacco Corporation v. Court of Appeals and Manila Surety
& Fidelity Co., Inc., L-10894, March 24, 1958)
(b) Examples

A went to a store and offered to buy a certain watch
for PIOO.OOO. The seller said he was willing to give it for
P120.000. Whereupon, A turned to go away because he
did not want to pay that price. The seller called him back
and said he was willing to sell the watch for PIOO.OOO. Is
A allowed not to buy said watch?
ANS.: Yes. A’s offer was PIOO.OOO. This was not
accepted. Or granting that the proposal of P120.000 was
a sort of acceptance, the statement that the buyer could
have it for P120.000 was not absolute. It was a qualified
acceptance and hence, under the law, constitutes a counter¬
offer. Hence, when the seller said P120.00O, he was not
really accepting the offer to buy. Now, when he was going
to give it for PIOO.OOO, he was not really accepting the offer
of A, but was making another offer, a counter-offer since
the offer made by A previously had been rejected by him
(the seller).

[NOTE: A counter-offer as a matter of fact extinguishes

the offer. Moreover, it may or may not be accepted by the
original offeror. (See Trillana v. Quezon Colleges, L-5003,
June 27, 1953)]
Cornejo v. Calupitan
48 O.G. 621, Feb. 1952

FACTS: On Jan. 4, 1945, Cornejo offered to buy
Calupitan’s land for P650.000 (in Japanese money) with
a deposit of P70.000. The balance was to be paid on or
before Jan. 19, 1945. Calupitan agreed. But on Jan. 6,
1945, the buyer gave only P65.000 as deposit instead of
P70.000, and he wrote to Calupitan that the balance was
to be paid on Jan. 25, 1945. Calupitan agreed to this new
plan, but imposed the condition that said balance should
be given in genuine Philippine money. On Jan. 22, 1945,
Comejo wanted to give the balance in Japanese money but
he could not find Calupitan, so he consigned said balance
621

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1319

in court. At the same time, he sued Calupitan for specific
performance and damages.

HELD: The action will not prosper. The first
agreement was abandoned by Cornejo himself when he
did not comply with his promise. The second proposal was
not perfected, for the acceptance was conditional, namely,
the giving of the balance in genuine Philippine currency.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1319

that the corporation had definitely accepted the offer. The
phrase “willing to accept” merely indicated a disposal to
accept in principle subject to certain considerations, such
as the examination of the second hand sawmill and the
spare parts; the determination of the number and quality
of tractors to be given in exchange, the possibility of
bargaining all of which required consultations and “a
possible arrangement.”

Zayco v. Serra
44 Phil. 326
FACTS:Serra offered to sell a Central either for cash,
or on an installment basis, the balance to be paid in three
years. The total price was Pl,000,000. Zayco, to whom the
Central was offered, wrote to Serra stating among other
things that he was giving P100.000 or 1/10 of the price as
downpayment, the balance to be paid in some other way.

FACTS: An attempted compromise at the figure of
Pl,508.28 in cash was met with a tender and payment of
P800.

ISSUE: Was there a meeting of the minds?
HELD: No, there was no meeting of the minds for
when Zayco offered P100.000 as downpayment, this was
really a qualified acceptance, because Serra’s offer did not
specify how much should be the initial payment. When
Zayco offered P100.000 and not any other amount as
downpayment, this was in the nature of a proposal by itself.

Meads v. Land Settlement and
Development Corporation
98 Phil. 119

FACTS: In an offer of barter involving second-hand
sawmill equipment and additional spare parts valued at
P12.000 on the one hand and an, as yet, undetermined
number of tractors of various qualities on the other
hand, the offeree, the Land Settlement and Development
Corporation, answered: “We are willing to accept the
proposition, in which case please see our Mr. F.J. Domatay,
of the Property Department for possible arrangement.”

ISSUE: Was there a meeting of the minds here?
HELD: No, there was no meeting of the minds for
the abovementioned clause did not in any manner show

Batangan v. Cojuangco
78 Phil. 481

ISSUE: Was there a meeting of the minds?
HELD: No, because of the substantial variance in
the amount contained in the offer, and in the amount
tendered. For perfection, the offerer has first to assent to
the suggested modification caused by the reduction in the

Datoc v. Mendoza, et al.
(CjL) 47 O.G. 2427

FACTS: Would-be buyers, knowing fully well that
they could not pay the required P2,000 asked of them at
once and totally, nevertheless answered YES, keeping thia
mental reservation to themselves.
ISSUE: Was there a meeting of the minds?
HELD: There was no meeting of the minds in view of
the mental reservation. And granting that there was, still
the presence of causal fraud (dolo causante) necessarily
voids the contract.

Halili v. Lloret, et al.
95 Phil. 78

FACTS: While still in the process of negotiation, the
offeree legally suspended the payment of the check it had
issued for failure of the offerer to sign certain documents.
623

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1319

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ISSUE: Was there a contract here?
HELD: No, because the legal suspension of the check
payment clearly indicates that the transaction was merely
in the stage of negotiation; otherwise, the offeree would not
have been allowed to legally withdraw from the payment.

Clarin v. Rulona
L-30786, Feb. 20, 1984
(1)

The contract is valid even if one of the parties states
that he entered into it against his better judgment.
(3) A co-owner cannot sell a definite part of the coownership. (NOTE: In the instant case, however, the
Supreme Court unfortunately forgot that the share
being sold by the co-owner concerned was a definite
part since the share referred to that portion on which
his house had been constructed as already intimated,
the sale was deemed VALID.)

54 Phil. 782

HELD: Under the law, the offerer may fix the time,
place, and manner of acceptance. (See Art. 1321) Because
Montinola violated the rules, it cannot be said that there
was a meeting of the minds. Therefore, he could properly
be disqualified. Indeed, the basis of the right to a reward
is in the nature of a contract and rests on one side upon
conditions. (34 Cyc. 1731) In competitive contests for
rewards, the acceptance must be in strict conformity with
the offer, and a qualified acceptance does not create a
contract.

American President Lines, Ltd.
v. Richard A. Klepper
L-15671, Nov. 29, 1960
The act of the owner in shipping his goods on board
the ship of the carrier, and in paying the corresponding
freight thereon, shows that he impliedly accepted the
contract — the bill of lading — which had been issued in
connection with the shipment in question. It may be said
therefore that the same is binding upon him as if it had
been actually signed by him or by any other person in his
behalf.
624

Where a party to a contract of sale accepts payment,
this is an indication that said party has given his
consent to the contract.

Montinola v. Victorias Milling Co., et al.

FACTS: In order to encourage efficient sugar
production, the Victorias Milling Company, which was
operating a sugar central, conducted a contest, complete
with written rules. Montinola joined the contest, but
because he failed to follow some of the rules, the Company
had no alternative except to disqualify him for any prize. He
now alleges lack of authority on the part of the Company
to disqualify him.

Art. 1319

(7) Query

A offered 20 fountain pens to B for Pl,000 each. B answered
by letter that he was willing to purchase 30 fountain pens at
said price at Pl,000 each. Is the contract perfected?

ANS.: It depends:
(a)

(b)

If B wanted 30 pens and would not be satisfied with less,
the acceptance can be considered as qualified, so there has
been no perfection yet.
If B was contented with 20 pens, but desired, if possible to
get 10 more, there is a perfected sale regarding the original

20, and an offer with respect to the extra ten. Unless
accepted in turn, there would be NO contract yet with
respect to the additional ten fountain pens. (See Tolentino,
Civil Code of the Phil., Vol. V, p. 413)
[NOTE:

If an offerer offers several distinct and separate items,
and the offeree accepts one of them, the contract is perfected as
to the item accepted. Thus, if a contractor offers to the RFC to
construct a building for P389,980 complete with all installations;
for P18.900 if no building but only electrical installations are
to be made; for P12,600 if no building but only for plumbing
installations and the RFC awards it a contract only for the
plumbing installations (P12,600), the contract is perfected
625

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1319

insofar as said plumbing installations are concerned. This is
so because the proposal of the contractor consisted of several
items, each one of them complete in itself, and distinct, separate,
and independent from the other items. It cannot be said that
there was a modification of the offer or only a partial acceptance
thereof. Indeed, the award given by the RFC was an unqualified
acceptance of the third item, which item constituted a complete
offer by itself. (Valencia v. Rehabilitation Finance Corporation,
et al., L-10749, April 25, 1958)]
(8) Acceptance through Correspondence

Rule: “Acceptance made by letter or telegram does not bind
the offerer except from the time it came to his knowledge.
The contract in such a case is presumed to have been
entered into in the place where the offer was made.”
(b) The knowledge may be actual or constructive (as when the
letter of acceptance has been received in the house of the
offerer by a person possessed of reasonable discernment).
If actual knowledge be required, proof of this would be
almost impossible, for even when the letter containing the
answer has been opened and read, the offerer can always
claim, in some cases truthfully, that while he was reading
the same, his mind was elsewhere, and he did not actually
know the contents of said answer.

Sambrano v. Court of Tax Appeals
101 Phil. 1
FACTS: Sambrano was indebted to the government
for P184.000 by way of tax liabilities. To guarantee this tax
obligation, he executed a chattel mortgage. Because of his
inability to pay, he offered by way of compromise, the payment
of P70,000 in cash, and PIO,000 payable within 30 days. The
Secretary of Finance favorably recommended the approval of the
offer, and on Sept. 9, 1954, the Collector of Internal Revenue
informed Sambrano’s attorney of the acceptance of the offer.
Apparently unaware of the acceptance, said attorney withdrew
the offer on Sept. 24, 1954. Having been apprised of this move,
the Secretary of Finance ordered the Collector to effect the
collection of the entire tax liability.

ISSUE: Was there a meeting of the minds on the

compromise plan?

[NOTE: A compromise is considered by the Code to be a
contract.]

HELD: No, there was no meeting of the minds because
Sambrano through his counsel revoked the offer before he learned
of its acceptance by the Secretary of Finance and the Collector
of Internal Revenue.

Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation v.

(9) Cases

Laudico v. Arias
43 Phil. 270
FACTS: On Feb. 5, 1919, Arias wrote Laudico a letter,
offering a lease contract. On March 6, 1919, Laudico wrote a
letter of complete acceptance, which was received by Arias that
same afternoon. But that same morning, Arias had already
written Laudico a letter withdrawing the offer.
ISSUE: Was there a contract here?
HELD: No, because prior to receipt of the letter of
acceptance, the offer had already been withdrawn. In other
words, it does not matter that the letter of withdrawal may have
been received later by the offeree than receipt of the letter of
acceptance by the offerer. What is important is that the letter
of withdrawal was MADE prior to the knowledge of acceptance.
626

Court of Appeals
GR 55998, Jan. 17, 1985
Even if the draft renewal contract had not been signed by
the lessor, the parties may be deemed to have agreed to renew
their lease contract considering the exchanges of letters between,
and the implementing acts of, the parties.
(10) Rule If Letter of Acceptance Is Withdrawn or Revoked

A letter of acceptance may in turn be withdrawn or revoked.

PROBLEM:
A offered on Jan. 1. B accepted on Jan. 8. The letter of
acceptance was received by A on Jan. 15. But on Jan. 12, B had
already written a letter revoking the acceptance. Was there a
meeting of the minds?
627

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1320

ANS.:
1)

2)

If the letter revoking the acceptance was received by A
BEFORE Jan. 15 (receipt of the letter of acceptance), there
is no question that there was no meeting of the minds.
(Reyes & Puno, supra, p. 186; Manresa and Tolentino,
supra, p. 418)

But if the letter revoking the acceptance, although made
previously, was nevertheless received by A only AFTER
Jan. 15 (receipt of the letter of acceptance), Reyes, Puno and
Tolentino believe that there was already a meeting of the
minds Thus, Profs. Reyes and Puno say that the revocation
of the acceptance “must reach and be learned by the offerer
ahead of the acceptance.” (Reyes and Puno, op. cit., p. 186)
Prof. Tolentino in turn says: “Where the offeree has sent
his acceptance, but then sends a rejection or a revocation
of the acceptance, which reaches the offerer BEFORE the
acceptance, there is NO meeting of the minds, because the
revocation has cancelled or nullified the acceptance which
thereby ceased to have any legal effect.” (Tolentino, op. cit.,
p. 418) On the other hand, Manresa maintains the contrary
view, for what is important is that at the time of receipt
of the letter of acceptance, there had already been a prior
revocation of said acceptance. In other words, at the exact
moment of alleged meeting of the minds (Jan. 15), there
really was NO concurrence of minds or wills.
An offer by telegram is governed NOW by the same
rules for letters, but there was a time when to be valid it
had to be followed by a letter of confirmation, unless the
mode of communicating by telegram had previously been
agreed upon in a written contract. (See Engel v. Mariano
Velasco and Co., 47 Phil. 115)

Art. 1320. An acceptance may be express or implied.

COMMENT:
(1) Forms of Acceptance

Art. 1321

(b)

implied (Art. 1320) from conduct, or acceptance of
unsolicited services (Perez v. Pomar, 2 Phil. 682);

(c)

presumed (by law) as when there is failure to repudiate
hereditary rights within the period fixed by law (See Art.
1057, Civil Code); or when there is SILENCE in certain
specific cases as would tend to mislead the other party, and
thus place the silent person in estoppel. (See Arts. 1670,
1870, 1871, 1872 and 1873, Civil Code)

(2) Examples of Implied Acceptance

An offer by the Army to reward persons giving information
that would lead to the apprehension of certain Huks may
be considered implicitly accepted when the act referred to
it is performed by members of the public.
(b) In the same way, participation in a contest, with full
compliance of its rules, is implied acceptance of the offer.
Thus, on one occasion, the Supreme Court has said that
“due to the fact that the bank started, and advertised the
contest offering prizes, under certain conditions and the
plaintiff prepared, by labor and expense, and took part in
said contest, the bank is bound to comply with its promise
made in the rules and conditions prepared and advertised
by it.” (De la Rosa v. Bank of the Phil. Islands, 51 Phil. 926)
(a)

(3) Implied Rejection

Upon the other hand, refusal or rejection of an offer may
also be inferred from acts and circumstances, like the failure
to act on an offer of compromise before the court enters final
judgment on a case. (Batangan v. Cojuangco, 78 Phil. 481)
Similarly, an offer to remit interest, provided the principal is
paid, is deemed rejected when the debtor fails to pay the debt,
and the creditor was constrained to sue for collection thereof.

The rule stated in this Article applies also to an auction
sale, whether it be a public or a private one. (Leoquinco v. Postal
Savings Bank, 47 Phil. 772)
(3) Contract to Purchase

Consolidated Mills, Inc. v.
Reparations Commission
76 SCRA 18
A "contract to purchase” which does not give specific
description of the objects to be purchased nor the price nor the
rate of exchange to be used is a mere preliminary agreement.
(4) Case

Douglas Millares and Rogelio Lagda v. NLRC,
Trans-Global Maritime Agency, Inc. & Esso
International Shipping Co., Ltd.
GR 110524, July 29, 2002

The Civil Code has always recognized, and continues to
recognize, the validity and propriety of contracts and obligations
with a fixed or definite period, and imposes no restraints on the
freedom of parties to fix the duration of a contract, whatever
its object, be it specific, goods or services, except the general
admonition against stipulations contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public order, or public policy.

Under the Civil Code, therefore, and as a general
proposition, fixed-term employment contracts are not limited,
630

seasonal or for specific projects with pre-determined dates of
completion; they also include those to which the parties by free
choice have assigned a specific date of termination.

[NOTE: Some familiar examples may be cited of
employment contract which may be neither for seasonal work
nor for specific projects, but to which a fixed term is an essential
and natural appurtenance: overseas employment contracts,
for one, to which, whatever the nature of the engagement, the
concept of regular employment with all that it implies does not
appear ever to have been applied. (Millares, et al. v. NLRC, etc.,
supra)]
[NOTE: Article 280 of the Labor Code notwithstanding,
also appointments to the positions of dean, assistant dean,
college secretary, principal, and other administrative officers
in educational institutions, which are by practice or tradition
rotated among the faculty members, and where fixed terms
are a necessity without which no reasonable rotation would be
possible. Similarly, despite the provisions of Art. 280, Policy
Instructions 8 of the Minister (Secretary) of Labor implicitly
recognize that certain company officials may be elected for what
would amount to fix periods, at the expiration of which they
would have to stand down, in providing that these officials, may
lose their jobs as president, executive vice-president or vicepresident, etc. because the stockholders or the board of directors
for one reason or another did not reelect them. (Millares, et al.
v. NLRC, etc., supra)]

Art. 1322. An offer made through an agent is accepted
from the time acceptance is communicated to him.

COMMENT:
(1) Acceptance of an Offer Made Through an Agent

The Article applies when BOTH the offer and the acceptance
are made through an AGENT (who is an extension of the
personality of the principal). (Art. 1910, par. 4, Civil Code)
(b) Any other intermediary (who is not an agent, with power to
bind) is merely a sort of messenger, who must communicate

(a)

631

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1323

to the person who sends him; otherwise, there is as yet no
meeting of the minds.
(2) Query

Suppose the principal himself made the offer, and

acceptance is communicated to the agent, would the Article
apply? In other words, would there already be a meeting of the

minds?

ANS.: It is submitted that as a general rule, there would
as yet be no meeting of the minds, for the agent may be an
ordinaiy one, not authorized to receive the acceptance for the
PARTICULAR transaction. However, if the agent was expressly
authorized to receive the acceptance, or if the offeree had been
told that acceptance could be made direct with the agent, who
would then be given freedom to act or to proceed, there can be
a meeting of the minds and a perfection of the contract.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

[NOTE: If one of the parties at the time of making the offer
OR the acceptance was already insane, it may be said that there
is a meeting of the minds, in a sense, because the contract is not
void, but merely VOIDABLE, that is, it is valid until annulled.]
(4) Other Instances

There are other instances when the offer becomes
ineffective, namely:
(a) When the offeree expressly or impliedly rejects the offer.
(b) When the offer is accepted with a qualification or condition
(for here, there would merely arise a counter-offer).
(c) When before acceptance is communicated, the subject
matter has become illegal or impossible.
(d) When the period of time given to the offeree within which
he must signify his acceptance has already lapsed.
(e)

Art. 1323. An offer becomes ineffective upon the death,
civil interdiction, insanity, or insolvency of either party before
acceptance is conveyed.

COMMENT:
(1) When Offer Becomes Ineffective

Article 1323 gives four instances when the offer becomes
ineffective.
(2) Example

A makes an offer to B on Jan. 1. B makes known his
acceptance in a letter received at the house of A on Jan. 5.
However, on Jan. 4, A had died. Here, the offer is ineffective
because there was no meeting of the minds.
(3) Another Example

A makes an offer to B on Jan. 1. B writes a letter on Jan.
3, accepting the offer. This letter is received by A on Jan. 5. But
on Jan. 4, B had died. Here the offer is also ineffective, because
there was no meeting of the minds.
632

Art. 1324

When the offer is revoked in due time (that is, before the
offeror has learned of its acceptance by the offeree). (See
Laudico v. Arias, 43 Phil. 270)

Art. 1324. When the offerer has allowed the offeree
certain period to accept, the offer may be withdrawn at any
time before acceptance by communicating such withdrawal,
except when the option is founded upon a consideration, as
something paid or promised.

COMMENT:
(1) General Rule on Options

If the offerer has allowed the offeree a certain period to
accept, the offer may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance
(or the thing being offered) by communicating such withdrawal.
Example:
B, interested in a particular car at a car exchange company,
asked S for the price. S said: “P3,500,000.” B however could not
make up his mind whether to buy or not. So S told B, “B, I’ll
give you a week to make up your mind. In the meantime, I will
reserve this car for you.” Before the week is over, can S withdraw
the offer to sell the car for P3,500,000?
633

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1324

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1824

ANS.: Yes, provided B has not yet signified his acceptance
of the offer to sell, that is, B has not yet bought the car, and
provided that S communicates such withdrawal to B. Thus, S
may, without liability to B, sell to another.

at a fixed price. The contract of option is a separate and distinct
contract from the contract which the parties may enter into upon
the consummation of the contract. Therefore, an option must
have its own cause or consideration (Enriquez de la Cavada v.

Another Example:

Diaz, 37 Phil. 982), a cause distinct from the selling price itself.
(See Millar v. Nadres, 74 Phil. 307) Of course, the consideration

BAR
A offered to sell his house and lot for P10M to B, who was
interested in buying the same. In his letter to B, A stated that
he was giving B a period of one month within which to raise
the amount, and that as soon as B is ready, they will sign the
deed of sale. One week before the expiration of the one-month
period, A went to B, and told him that he is no longer willing to
sell the property unless the price is increased to P15M. May B
compel A to accept the P10M first offered, and execute the sale?
Reasons.

ANS.: No, because here the promise to sell (or the option
granted B to buy) had no cause or consideration distinct from
the selling price. (Arts. 1479 and 1324, Civil Code; See Mendoza,
et al. v. Comple, L-19311, Oct. 29, 1965)

Cronico v. J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc.
78 SCRA 331
To be binding on the person who made a unilateral promise,
the promise must be supported by a cause or consideration
distinct from the price.
(2) Exception

When the option is founded upon a consideration as
something paid or promised.
Example: If, in the preceding example, S had been given
P20,000 by B in consideration for the option, S cannot withdraw
the offer to sell until after the expiration of the one-week period.
(3) ‘Option’ Defined

It is a contract granting a person the privilege to buy or
not to buy certain objects at any time within the agreed period
634

may be pure liberality. This is akin to the option contract of
derivatives (financial instruments). (See Securities Regulation
Code and IRR).
(4) Perfection of an Option

Since an option is by itself a contract, it is not perfected
unless there is a meeting of the minds on the option. Thus, the
offer to grant an option, even if founded on a distinct cause or
consideration, may itself be withdrawn before the acceptance of
the offer of an option.
Example:

In the preceding example under comment No. (1), if S had
offered to grant B a week’s time if B would give P20,000 may S
still withdraw the offer of option before B signifies his acceptance
thereof?
ANS.: Yes, because here the option does not yet exist.
[NOTE: When the law therefore says “except when the
option is founded upon a consideration, as something paid or
promised,” the word “option” here refers to a “perfected contract
of option," that is, the option already exists.]
[NOTE: There is therefore a difference between acceptance
of the offer of option ( which results in the contract of option), and
acceptance of the object being offered for sale or acceptance of the
offer of sale (which results in the contract of sale).]

Atkins, Kroll, and Co. v. Cua Hian Tek
L-9871, Jan. 31, 1958

FACTS: On Sept. 13, 1951, Atkins, Kroll and Co.,
Incorporated offered to sell to B Cua Hian Tek 1,000 cartons
of sardines subject to reply by Sept. 23, 1951. The respondent
offeree accepted the offer unconditionally and delivered his letter
of acceptance on Sept. 21, 1951. In view however of the shortage
635

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait 1326

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

of the catch of sardines by the California packers, Atkins, Kroll,
and Co. failed to deliver the commodities it had offered for sale.
Offeree now claims that acceptance of the offer only created an
option to buy which, lacking consideration distinct from the
price, had no obligatory force.
HELD: The offerer is wrong. The argument is untenable,
because acceptance of the offer to sell by showing the intention to
buy for a price certain creates bilateral contract to sell and buy.
The offeree, upon acceptance, ipso facto assumes the obligation of
a buyer, so much so that he can be sued should he back out after
acceptance, by either refusing to get the thing sold or refusing to
receive the price agreed upon. Upon the other hand, the offerer
would be Hable for damages, if he fails to debver the thing he
had offered for sale.

Even granting that an option is granted, which is not
binding for lack of consideration, the authorities hold that “if
the option is given without a consideration, it is a mere offer of a
contract of sale, which is not binding until accepted.” If however
acceptance (of the sale, as distinguished from the acceptance
merely of the option) is made before a withdrawal, it constitutes
a binding contract of sale, even if the option was not supported
by a sufficient consideration.” (7 Corpus Juris Secundum, p. 652)
[NOTE: The rule in the instant case reverses the principle
held in Southwestern Sugar & Molasses Co. v. Atlantic Gulf &
Pacific Co., 97 Phil. 249.]

Art. 1325. Unless it appears otherwise, business
advertisements of things for sale are not definite offers, but
mere invitations to make an offer.

COMMENT:
Business Advertisements

Are business advertisements of things for sale definite
offers?
ANS.: It depends:
(a)

If appears to be a definite offer containing all the specific
particulars needed in a contract, it really is a definite offer.
636

Art. 1326

Example:

“For Sale: 900 sq. meter lot with a brand new 1-1 !2
storey house at 1 445 Perdigon, Paco, Manila for Pl 0 million
cash." This is a definite offer, from which the advertiser
cannot back out, once it is accepted by another.
(b)

If important details are left out, the advertisement is not
a definite offer, but a mere invitation to make an offer.
Example:

‘For Sale: 1000 sq. meter lots at Pl 00 million to
P150 million a lot at South Forbes Park Tel. 88-00-00.” This
is clearly merely an invitation to make an offer, which the
advertiser is free to accept or to reject.
Art. 1326. Advertisements for bidders are simply
invitations to make proposals, and the advertiser is not bound
to accept the highest or lowest bidder, unless the contrary

appears.

COMMENT:
(1) Advertisement for Bidders

Note that as a general rule, the advertiser is NOT bound
to accept the highest or lowest bidder.
(2) Problem

In an advertisement for bidders, there was NO reservation
by the advertiser that he could reject any and all bids. Now then,
is he still given the right to reject even the highest bidder (as
when the offer is to sell) or the lowest bidder (as when his offer
is to buy)?
ANS.: Yes, for the rule is that “the advertiser is not bound to
accept the highest or lowest bidder, unless the contrary appears.”
(Art. 1326, Civil Code)
(3) Acceptance of a Bid

The mere determination of a public official or board to
accept the proposal of a bidder does NOT constitute a contract;
637

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1326

the decision must be communicated to the bidder. (Jalandoni v.
National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Adm., et al., L-15198,
May 30, 1960)
(4) Bidder Submits to Conditions

Anybody participating in the bidding at a public auction is
understood to have submitted himself to all the conditions set
forth at such sale. (Leoquinco v. Postal Savings Bank, 47 Phil.
772)

Leoquinco v. Postal Savings Bank
47 Phil. 772

FACTS: The Board of Directors of the Postal Savings Bank
authorized the sale at public auction of a parcel of land it owned
at Navotas, Rizal. The Board expressly reserved “the right to
reject any and all bids.” The auction notice also contained such
reservation. Leoquinco offered the highest bid (P27.000) but this
was rejected by the Board. Leoquinco then sued to compel the
Bank to execute and deliver the deed of sale, with damages.

HELD: The action will not prosper, for there really was
no sale. By participating in the auction and offering his bid,
he voluntarily submitted to the terms and conditions of the
auction sale announced in the notice, and he therefore clearly
acknowledged the right of the Board to reject any and all bids.
The owner of property offered for sale at a public or private
auction has the right to prescribe the manner, conditions, and
terms of such sale. He may even provide that all of the purchase
price shall be paid at the time of sale, or any portion thereof, or
that time will be given for the payment. (Blossom v. Milwaukee
and Chicago Railroad Co., 3 Wallace U.S. 196) The conditions
are binding upon the purchaser, whether he knew them or not.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1327

by the bidder). The term “lowest responsible bidder” includes not
only financial ability, but also the skill and capacity necessary to
complete the job for which the bidder would become answerable.
The expression “lowest and best bidder” is even wider and
includes not only financial responsibility, skill, and capacity,
BUT ALSO the reputation of the bidders for dealing fairly and
honestly with the government, their mechanical facilities, and
business organization tending to show dispatch in their work
and harmonious relations with the government, the magnitude
and urgency of the job, the kind and quality of materials to be
used, and other factors as to which a bidder may offer greater
advantages than another. (See Borromeo v. City of Manila, 62

Phil. 512)

(6) Bids at Execution Sales

In an execution sale of properties attached for the payment
of debts, it is generally understood that the property should be
given to the highest bidder. In the case of the execution sale
of the extrequdicial family home whose value is believed to be
more than the P30,000 or P20,000 fixed by law, the lowest bid
that can be accepted is one that exceeds such values; therefore,
the highest bid thereon must necessarily be higher than said
values. (See Art. 249, Civil Code)
Art. 1327. The following cannot give consent to a contract:
(1) Unemancipated minors;
(2) Insane or demented persons, and deaf-mutes who
do not know how to write.

COMMENT:
(1) Two Classes of Voidable Contracts
(a)

(5) Problem

Those where one party is incapacitated to give consent.

(Art. 1327, Civil Code)

In an advertisement for bidders, it was stated that the
award should be given not to the “lowest bidder,” not to the
“lowest responsible bidder," but to the “lowest and best bidder.”
Distinguish the terms used.
ANS.: The “lowest bidder” is he who offers the lowest price
(as in the case of a purchase by the bidder, or a contract for work
638

(b)

Those where the consent of one party has been vitiated

(such as by error, fraud, violence, intimidation, and undue
influence). (Arts. 1330-1334, Civil Code)

[NOTE: These contracts in general are valid until
annulled; however, annulment cannot prosper when they
have been ratified. (See Art. 1390, Civil Code)]

provided, furthermore, that the minor is 18 years old

(2) Persons Incapacitated to Consent

(a)

Unemancipated minors.

(b)

Insane or demented persons (unless they acted during a
lucid interval), drunks and those hypnotized. (Art. 1328,
Civil Code)
Deaf-mutes who do not know how to write (and read).
[NOTE: If they know how to read, but do not know
how to write, it is submitted that the contract is valid, for
then they are capable of understanding, and therefore
capacitated to give consent.]

(c)

(3) Unemancipated Minors

(a)

These are the minors who have not been emancipated by

marriage, attainment of the age of majority, or by parental
or judicial authority. (Art. 1397, Civil Code)
[NOTE: The State by virtue of the principle of parens
patriae is obliged to minimize the risk to those who,
because of their minority, are as yet unable to take care
of themselves fully. (People v. Bayion, L-35785, May 29,
1974) This prerogative of parens patriae is inherent in the
supreme power of every state. ( Cabanas v. Pilapil, L-25843,
July 25, 1974)]
[NOTE: As between the mother and the uncle of
a minor, the former is preferred to act as trustee of the
proceeds of the insurance policy of the deceased father
in the absence of evidence indicating that said mother is

incompetent. (Ibid.)]
(b)

In general, the contracts which they enter into are

VOIDABLE unless:
1)
2)

3)

Upon reaching the age of majority, they ratify the
same. (Ibanez v. Rodriguez, 47 Phil. 554)
They were entered into through a guardian, and the
court having jurisdiction had approved the same. (Roa
u. Roa, 52 Phil. 879)
They were contracts of life insurance in favor of
their parents, spouse, children, brothers, sisters, and
640

Art. 1327

or above. (See Act No. 3870)
4)

They were in the form of savings account in the Postal
Savings Bank, provided furthermore that the minor
was at least seven years old. (See Sec. 2007, Rev. Adm.

Code)
5)

They were contracts for necessities such as food, but
here the people who are legally bound to give them
support should pay therefor. (See Arts. 1489, 2164,
Civil Code)

6)

They were contracts where the minor misrepresented
his age, and pretended to be one of major age and is,
thus, in ESTOPPEL. (Marcelo v. Espiritu, 37 Phil. 37;
Sia Suan v. Alcantara, 47 O.G. 4561; and Hermosa v.
Zobel, L-11835, Oct. 30, 1958) It is, however, essential
here that the other party must have been MISLED.
(Bambalan v. Maramba, 51 Phil. 417)
(c) Married minors can validly alienate or encumber personal
property without parental consent, but in the case of
real property or if they want to borrow money, they need
such parental consent, without which the transaction is
voidable. (See Art. 399, Civil Code)
(d) If both parties to a contract are minors, the
contract is
unenforceable. (Art. 1403, No. [3] states that contracts
“where both parties are incapable of giving consent to a
contract” are UNENFORCEABLE.)
(4) Insane or Demented Persons (Unless They

a Lucid Interval)

(a)

Acted During

Reason: People who contract must know what they are
entering into.
(b) No proper declaration of insanity by the court
is required,
as long as it is shown that at the time of contracting, the
person was really insane. (18 Manresa 660)
(c) Even if a person had already been declared insane,
this
does not necessarily mean that at the time of contracting,
said person was still insane. (Dumaguin v. Reynolds, 48

O.G. 3887)

641

Art. 1327

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(d)

Upon the other hand, if the contract was made before the
declaration of insanity, the presumption is that he was
still SANE at the time of contracting. He who alleged the
insanity of another at the time of contracting is duty-bound
to prove the same, otherwise the latter’s capacity must be
presumed. (Carillo v. Jaoco, 45 Phil. 597)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

personal property) are VOID unless approved by the
governor or his representative. (Secs. 146 and 147, Adm.
Code of Mindanao and Sulu) Reason: To prevent their
ignorance from being preyed upon. (Porken o. Yatco, 70
Phil. 161) It is understood, however, that the rule applies
only to those entered into within the territory covered
by the former department of Mindanao and Sulu. (See
City of Manila v. Narvasa, L-8545, Dec. 29, 1955; see also
Mangayao v. De Guzman, L-24787, Feb. 22, 1974)

(5) Deaf-Mutes Who Do Not Know How to Write (and Read)

Formerly, a deaf-mute was presumed to be an idiot. (See
Director of Lands v. Abelardo, 54 Phil. 387)
(b) If a deaf-mute does not know how to write but he knows
how to read, he should be considered capacitated.

Art. 1323

(a)

*

Art. 1328. Contracts entered into during a lucid interval
are valid. Contracts agreed to in a state of drunkenness or
during a hypnotic spell are voidable.

(6) Persons Specially Disqualified

There are people who are SPECIALLY DISQUALIFIED in
certain things. Here, the transaction is VOID because the right
itself is restricted, that is, the right is WITHHELD. (In the case
of mere legal incapacity, the transaction is VOIDABLE because
the right itself is not restricted, but merely its EXERCISE, that
is, it can still be exercised but under certain conditions, such as
when the parents of an unemancipated minor consent.)
(7) Examples of Persons Specially Disqualified

As a general rule, the husband and wife cannot sell to
each other (Art. 1490, Civil Code), nor can they donate to
each other. (Art. 134, Civil Code) Violations are considered
VOID contracts, but only those prejudiced can assail the
validity of the transaction. (Harding v. Commercial Union
Assurance Co., 38 Phil. 464; and Cook v. McMicking, 27
Phil. 10)
(b) Insolvents before they are discharged cannot, for example,
make payments. (See Insolvency Law, Sec. 24)
(c) Persons disqualified because of fiduciary relationship,
such as the guardian, who is not allowed to purchase
the property of his ward; or judges, with reference to the
property under litigation. (Art. 1491, Civil Code)

COMMENT:
(1) Some Voidable Contracts by Reason of Incapacity

The voidable contracts referred to in this Article are those
entered into by:
(a)

lucid interval);

(b)

Those in the state of drunkenness (which temporarily
results in complete loss of understanding, and may
therefore be equivalent to temporary insanity). (TS, Nov.
6, 1858 and TS, April 21, 1911);

(c)

Those entered into during a hypnotic spell (induced by
drugs, or by deliberate or unintentional hypnotism) or
while a person walks during his sleep, somnambulism, for
in these cases, a person is incapable of intelligent consent.
(See 8 Manresa 660-661)

(a)

(d)

Contracts entered into with non-Christians (except
contracts of personal service and the barter or sale of
642

Insane or demented persons (unless they acted during a

(2) Lucid Intervals

Even if a person has already been judicially declared insane,
and is actually now under guardianship, he may still enter into
a valid contract, provided that it can be shown that at the time
of contracting, he was in a lucid interval. Of course here, he
is already presumed insane, and therefore the sanity must be
proved. (Dumaguin v. Reynolds, et al., 92 Phil. 66)
643

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1329

(3) Insanity in Some Things, But Sanity in Other Things

There are countless instances of individuals who are
mentally deranged, and have obsessions and delusions regarding
certain subjects and situations and yet are still mentally sound
in other respects. (Dumaguin v. Reynolds, et al., 92 Phil. 66)
Art. 1329. The incapacity declared in Article 1327 is
subject to the modifications determined by law, and is
understood to be without prejudice to special disqualification
established in the laws.

COMMENT:
(1) Modifications Re Incapacity
(a)

For a discussion of “special disqualifications,”see comment
Nos. 7 and 8 under Art. 1327.

(b)

Regarding contracts entered into by non-Christians,
approval by the officials concerned is required even if BOTH
parties are non-Christians, because both imposition and
fraud are still possible in this case. (Modale, et al. v. Raya,
et al., 92 Phil. 558)

(2) Incompetents under the Rules of Court

Under the Rules of Court, the following are considered
incompetents, and may be placed under guardianship:
(a)

those under civil interdiction

(b)

hospitalized lepers
prodigals (spendthrifts)

(c)
(d)
(e)

(f)

deaf and dumb who are unable to read and write
those of unsound mind even though they have lucid
intervals
those who by reason of age, disease, weak mind, and
other similar causes, cannot without outside aid,
take care of themselves and manage their property,
becoming thereby an easy prey for deceit and
exploitation. (Sec. 2, Rule 92, Revised Rules of Court)
644

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1330

(3) Problem

If a hospitalized leper or a very old man has not been placed
under guardianship, may he still enter into a binding contract?
ANS.: Yes, because he would still be presumed capacitated
to enter into a contract (although classified as an “incompetent”).
Of course, if it can be shown that intelligent consent was absent,
the contract can be considered VOIDABLE. (See Cui, et al. v.

Cui, et al., 100 Phil. 913)

[NOTE: There is, therefore, a difference between an
“incompetent” under the Rules of Court, and a person “who
cannot give consent to a contract” under the Civil Code.]
(4) Instance When a Person Is Not Incapacitated to Enter

into a Contract

Almeda v. Heirs of Ponciano Almaria
839 SCRA 630
(2017)

Mere forgetfulness, without evidence that the same has
removed from a person the ability to intelligently and firmly

protect his property rights, will not by itself incapacitate a person

from entering into contracts.

A person is not incapacitated toenter into a contract merely
because of advanced years or by reason of physical infirmities
unless such age and infirmities impair his mental facilities to
the extent that he is unable to properly, intelligently, and fairly
understand the provisions of said contract, or to protect his
property rights.

Art. 1330. A contract where consent is given through
mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence, or fraud is

voidable.

the TRUTH. They thus affect COGNITION.) Cognition must be

(2) Requisites for Mistake to Vitiate Consent
(a)

The error must be substantial regarding:
the object of the contract;

1)

intelligent.]

2)

the conditions which principally moved or induced one
of the parties (error in quality or in quantity error
in qualitate or in quantitate);

3)

identity or qualifications (error in personae), but only
if such was the principal cause of the contract.

[NOTE:Violence, intimidation, and undue influence affect

the WILL (which is the faculty in the mind of man, the proper
object of which is the GOOD. They thus affect VOLITION.)
Volition must be free.]
[NOTE: Mistake and fraud result in defects of the intellect;
the others result in defects of the will.]

(b)

The error must be excusable (not caused by negligence).

(c)

The error must be a mistake of fact, and not of law. (Luna
v. Linatoc, 74 Phil. 15)

(2) Nature of a Voidable Contract

A voidable contract is binding and valid, unless annulled by
a proper action in court. It is, however, susceptible of ratification
before annulment. (Art. 1390, Civil Code) Annulment may be
had even if there be NO damage to the contracting parties. (Art.
1390, 1st paragraph, Civil Code)

—

(3) Substantial Error

The error is substantial if because of it, the party gave his
consent. Therefore, if a party would still have entered into the
contract even if he had known of the error, the error is NOT
substantial. (8 Manresa 666)

(3) Clear and Convincing Evidence on the Vice of Consent

There must be clear and convincing evidence of the presence
of vitiated consent. Mere preponderance of evidence on this
matter is not sufficient. (Centenera v. Palicio, 29 Phil. 470)
Art. 1331. In order that mistake may invalidate consent, it
should refer to the substance of the thing which is the object
of the contract, or to those conditions which have principally
moved one or both parties to enter into the contract.
Mistake as to the identity or qualifications of one of
the parties will vitiate consent only when such identity or
qualifications have been the principal cause of the contract.
A simple mistake of account shall give rise to its
correction.
646

(4) Error Regarding the Object of the Contract

Example: A person signed a contract of sale thinking it
was only a contract of loan. (Dumasag v. Modelo, 34 Phil. 252;
Transports v. Beltran, [CA] 51 O.G. 1434, March, 1955])
(5) Error Regarding the Conditions That Principally Induced

the Party to Enter into the Contract
Example: Error in knowledge about the true boundaries
of a parcel of land offered for sale. (Mariano v. Linton, 45 Phil.
653)

[NOTE: Error as to personal motive does not vitiate
consent. Example: a boy buys an engagement ring in the false
belief that his girl loves him.]

647

Art. 1331

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Rural Bank of Caloocan v. Court of Appeals
L-32116, April 21, 1981

FACTS: Through alleged fraud committed by a third party
(the Valencia spouses), Maxima Castro found herself indebted

to a Rural Bank for a total debt of P6,000 (P3.000 was what
she intended to borrow; the Valencias added another P3,000
for themselves, with Castro signing the promissory note as co¬

maker).

ISSUE: For how much is Castro liable?
HELD: Only for P3,000. The contract can be partially
annulled insofar as Castro is concerned, not because of fraud
(neither party
the Bank nor Castro had committed fraud),
but because of mutual error caused by the fraud attributable to
the Valencias. The mortgage over Castro’s lot is reduced insofar
as it exceeds Castro’s personal loan.

have sold had a lesser price been offered), this would be not a
mere error of account, but truly a substantial error in quantity.]
[Note, therefore, the difference between error in quantity
and error in account. (He who alleges must prove the same).
(Gutierrez Hnos. v. Oria Hnos., 30 Phil. 491)]
(8) Error in Identity or in Qualifications

This vitiates consent only when such identity or
qualifications have been the principal cause of the contract.
Examples: Hiring of a pre-bar reviewer, a particular singer
for a concert, contracts involving partnership, agency, deposit
since these require trust and confidence. (See 8 Manresa 667-

—

669)

[NOTE: If any painter or singer would do, error as to
the identity of the particular painter or singer hired would be

immaterial.]

(6) Error in Quality

Examples: A person buys a fountain pen thinking it to be
made of solid gold when as a matter of fact, it is merely goldplated; a person buys a CD record thinking it to be Stateside,
but it turns out to be merely a local imitation, a pirated one.
(7) Error in Quantity

Example'. A person desiring to buy land consisting of 100
hectares discovers that the land has only 60 hectares. (See Asian
v. Jalandoni, 45 Phil. 296)
[NOTE: A simple mistake as to account, caused for example
by wrong arithmetical computation, would ordinarily give rise
merely to correction, and not annulment of the contract.

Example:

If A bought 10 notebooks at P5.20 each, and mistakenly,
the contract showed a total value of P55 instead of P52, this is
merely an error in computation, an error in account, and will
therefore require only correction. (8 Manresa 669-670) But even
here, had the seller sold the notebooks only because he thought
he would get P55, an amount he needed badly (and would not
648

(9) Excusable Error

The error does not vitiate consent if the party in error
was negligent, or if having had an opportunity to ascertain the
truth, he did not do so. (See, however, Art. 1332, Civil Code)
Moreover, there is no mistake if the party alleging it knew the
doubt, contingency or risk affecting the object of the contract.
(Art. 1333, Civil Code) Error as to how much profit a person
can make because of the transaction, cannot annul the contract
because in many cases, this is merely speculative. (See TS, Jan.
15, 1910)
(10) Error of Fact, Not of Law

The error must be one of fact, not of law. This is because
ignorance of the law does not excuse anyone from compliance
therewith. (Art. 3, Civil Code and 8 Manresa 646) Thus, if one
sells property in the false belief that conjugal property could
be partitioned during a marriage, the sale cannot be annulled.
(Luna, et al. v. Linatoc, 74 Phil. 15) Error of law, however, on a
doubtful or difficult question can exist together with good faith.
(Art. 526, Civil Code; and Kasilag v. Rodriguez, 69 Phil. 217)
649

Art. 1S32

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

[NOTE: “Mutual error as to the legal effect of an agreement
when the real purpose of the parties is frustrated, may vitiate
consent.” (Art. 1334, Civil Code) “Legal effect” here refers to the
rights of the parties as stated in the legal provisions.]

Art. 1332. When one of the parties is unable to read, or
if the contract is in a language not understood by him, and
mistake or fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract
must show that the terms thereof have been fully explained
to the former.

COMMENT:
(1) Rule in Case of Inability to Read or Understand

Reason for the Article:
“This rule is especially necessary in the Philippines where
unfortunately there is still a fairly large number of illiterates,
and where documents are usually drawn up in English or
Spanish.” (Report of the Code Commission, p. 136)
(2) Presumption

The natural presumption, of course, is that one always
acts with due care and signs with full knowledge of all the
contents of a document. And this is true even if the mind of the
party signing was confused at the time of signing, as long as he
still knew what he was doing. He, thus, cannot repudiate the
transaction. (Abaya v. Standard Vacuum Oil Co., L-9511, Aug.
30, 1957; Javier v. Javier, 7 Phil. 261; and Tan Tua v. Jy Liao
Sontua, 56 Phil. 70)
(3) When Presumption Does Not Apply

The presumption referred to cannot apply in the cases
contemplated under this Article:
(a)

when one of the parties is unable to read (including a blind
person) (Transporte v. Beltran, [CA.] 51 O.G. 1434);
(b) or if the contract is in a language not understood by one of
the parties. (Art. 1332, Civil Code)
650

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1332

In BOTH cases, “the person enforcing the contract
must show that the terms thereof have been fully explained
to the former.” (Art. 1332, Civil Code; and Ayola v.
Valderrama Lumber Manufacturers Co., Inc., [CA.] 49
O.G. 980)
(4) Cases

Ayola v. Valderrama Lumber
Manufacturers Co., Inc.
(CA) 49 O.G. 980

FACTS: Ayola, an illiterate person, signed a document
in the belief that it was a receipt of a part payment, when as
a matter of fact it was something else. The opposite party (the
Lumber Company) contended however, that what was important
is that Ayola had signed it, and therefore the same is binding on
him. It should be noted that in Ayola’s pleadings he expressly
said he had signed the voucher “without knowing its contents
which had not been explained to him.”
ISSUE: Who had the burden of proving that Ayola had
fully understood the contents of the document?
HELD: The Lumber Company had the burden of proving
that Ayola had fully understood the document’s contents,
because his plea was equivalent to an allegation of mistake or
fraud. Having failed to do so, the presumption of mistake (if not
fraud) stands unrebutted and controlling.
Transporte v. Beltran
(CA) 51 O.G. 1434
FACTS: Bonificia Transporte, blind since 1930, and already
70 years, affixed on Aug. 23, 1945 her thumbmark to a deed of
sale because she thought it was a deed of mortgage. The sale
was in favor of her son-in-law and was done through a public

instrument.
ISSUE: May the deed of sale be annulled?
HELD: Yes, the deed of sale can be annulled because of
failure on the part of the son-in-law to prove that he did not
take advantage of his favored situation as a son-in-law to enrich
651

Arts. 1333-1334

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

himself at the expense of an unfortunate relative. The fact
that the deed was in a public instrument is of no consequence,
for even here, courts are given a wide latitude in determining
what actually occurred, considering the age, physical infirmity,
intelligence, and relationship of the parties.
Art. 1333. There is no mistake if the party alleging it
knew the doubt, contingency or risk affecting the object of
the contract.

COMMENT:
(1) Knowledge of Doubt or Risk Does Not Vitiate Consent
It is to be assumed here that the party was willing to take
the risk. This is particularly true in contracts which are evidently
aleatory in nature.
(2) Example

A bought a fountain pen which was represented as possibly
being able to write even underwater. A also knew that the pen’s
ability was questionable, and yet A bought said pen. Here, A
cannot allege mistake since he knew beforehand of the doubt,
risk, or contingency affecting the object of the contract.
(3) Mistake Caused by Inexcusable Negligence

If mistake is caused by inexcusable negligence, the contract
cannot be annulled.
Art. 1334. Mutual error as to the legal effect of an
agreement when the real purpose of the parties is frustrated,
may vitiate consent.

COMMENT:
(1) Requisites for Mutual Error to Vitiate Consent

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1336

Example: A and B entered into a contract, which they
intended should result in a co-ownership between them, but
which turned out later to be a mortgage, as a result of their
mutual error as to the legal effect of the agreement. Here, the
contract is voidable.
(2) Reason for the Article

“Mistake of law does not generally vitiate consent, BUT
when there is a mistake on a doubtful question of law, or on the
construction or application of law, this is analogous to a mistake
of fact, and the maxim 'ignorantia legis neminem excusaf should
have no proper application. When even the highest courts are
sometimes divided upon difficult legal questions, and when
one-half of the lawyers in all controversies on a legal question
are wrong, why should a layman be held accountable for his
honest mistake on a doubtful legal issue?” (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 136)
(3) Distinguished from the Remedy of Reformation

This Article must be distinguished from Art. 1361 where
the remedy is reformation, not annulment. Thus, Art. 1361 of the
Civil Code reads: “When a mutual mistake of the parties causes
the failure of the instrument to disclose their real agreement,
said instrument may be reformed.”
[NOTE: Under Art. 1361, the real agreement is not
disclosed; in Art. 1334, the error is as to the legal effect of the
agreement. Example: A and B agreed on a sale, but as written,
the document shows a mortgage. Here, there was a meeting of
the minds, but the instrument does not show the real intention.
Hence, the remedy is reformation. If on the other hand, both
agreed on a sale, and as written, the document is one of sale, but
both parties thought erroneously that it had the same effects as
a mortgage, there is no meeting of the minds, and the remedy
is annulment]

(a)

There must be mutual error.

Art. 1335. There is violence when in order to wrest
consent, serious or irresistible force is employed.

(b)

The error must refer to the legal effect of the agreement.
The real purpose of the parties is frustrated.

There is intimidation when one of the contracting parties
is compelled by a reasonable and well-grounded fear of an

(c)

662

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1335

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

imminent and grave evil upon his person or property, or
upon the person or property of his spouse, descendants or
ascendants, to give his consent.
To determine the degree of the intimidation, the age, sex
and condition of the person shall be borne in mind.
A threat to enforce one’s claim through competent
authority, if the claim is just or legal, does not vitiate consent.

1056) But, of course, an agreement not to prosecute on
account of a crime is against public policy. (Arroyo v.
Berwin, 36 Phil. 386; and Hibberd v. Rhode, 32 Phil. 476)

(4) Reasonable and Well-Grounded Fear
(a)

Whether the fear is reasonable and well-grounded or not
depends upon many circumstances, including the age,
condition, and sex of the person concerned. (Art. 1335, par.
3)

COMMENT:
(1) Violence and Intimidation

(b)

A threat during the Japanese occupation to deliver
the person to the Japanese military authorities would
constitute intimidation (Rodriguez v. De Leon, 47 O.G.
6296), but not the mere fear that one may be so reported,
in the absence of an actual threat. Hence, the courts have
held that there was collective “duress” during the Japanese
occupation, in the absence of an actual threat. (Fernandez,
et al. v. Brownell, 51 O.G. 713 and Phil. Trust Co. v.
Luis Araneta, 83 Phil. 132) Mere knowledge that severe
penalties might be imposed is not enough. (Valdeabella v.
Marquez, [CA.] 48 O.G. 719) Indeed, in order to cause the
nullification of contracts executed during the Japanese
occupation, the duress or intimidation must be more than
the “general feeling of fear” on the part of the occupied
over the show of might by the occupant. (Lacson, et al. v.
Granada, et al., L-12035, March 29, 1961, citing People v.
Quillyo, L-2313, Jan. 10, 1951 and other cases)

(c)

The fear is reasonable and well-grounded when those
who threaten have power, and when maltreatment has
accompanied the threat. (Derequito v. Dolutan, [CA.] 45

Violence refers to physical coercion; intimidation, to moral
coercion.
Example: If a person signs a contract only because a gun
is pointed at him, this is intimidation because he is afraid he
would be killed. But if he signs because his left hand is being
twisted painfully, this is violence or force.
(2) Requisites for Violence to Vitiate Consent
(a)

Employment of serious or irresistible force;

(b)

It must have been the reason why the contract was entered
into.

(3) Requisites for Intimidation to Vitiate Consent

reasonable and well-grounded fear
of an imminent and grave evil
(c) upon his person, property, or upon the person or property
of his spouse, descendants, or ascendants
(d) it must have been the reason why the contract was entered
(a)

(b)

into
(e)

Art 1335

the threat must be of an unjust act, an actionable wrong.
(Therefore, a threat to enforce one’s claim through
competent authority, if the claim is just or legal, does not
vitiate consent.) (Art. 1335, last paragraph) A threat to
prosecute is not considered as intimidation. (P.P. Agustinos
v. Del Rey, 56 Phil. 512; Sotto v. Mariano, [CA.] 36 O.G.
654

O.G. 1351)
(d)

The fear is not well-grounded when the person who
threatened for instance to initiate expropriation proceedings
by the government, if the other party would not consent,
is in no position to accomplish the same, considering his
position as mere foreman in the Bureau of Public Works.
(Alarcon v. Kasilag, [CA.] 40 O.G. [Sup. 11], p. 203) The
same thing may be said of a vague threat to prevent an
alien from engaging in business in the Philippines. (Berg
v. Nat. City Bank, L-9312, Oct. 31, 1957)
655

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1335

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(5) Imminent and Grave Evil

v. Ledesma, 8 Phil. 601, citing Adams a. Irving N. Bank, 116
N.Y. 606, which holds that the threat of legal prosecution
of a husband amounts to intimidation of his wife who is
constrained thereby to become his surety.)

Thia again depends on the circumstances, particularly, the
age, sex, or condition of the person threatened. Thus, exposure
of a public official’s nightly indiscretions or immoralities is more
serious to him than is it a threat to a common day laborer.

[NOTE: If however a wife does what she does, not
because of fear, but because of common sense, fair play,

(6) Nature of the Threat on Person and Property of the

and a sense of justice, and upon the advice of competent
counsel, the contract is valid even if it was entered into
reluctantly. (Martinez v. Hongkong & Shanghai Bank,
15 Phil. 253; see also Tapis v. Carman and Elser, 60 Phil.

Persons Enumerated
(a)

It is believed that threat to honor, chastity, and dignity
may be classified under threat to “person.”

(b)

Query: Is the enumeration of persons exclusive in that
a threat, for example, to the life of one’s fiancee, is not
considered intimidation? It is submitted that the provision
must be liberally interpreted for indeed consent here is
vitiated just the same.

(7) Reason for Entering into the Contract

If the person concerned would have entered into the
contract even without the presence of intimidation, it is clear
that the contract should be considered valid, for the consent
certainly cannot be considered vitiated.
(8) Threat of an Unjust Act or an Actionable Wrong

(a)

If a man marries a girl who threatened to report him to
the Courts for immorality, and thus prevent his admission
to the bar, the marriage cannot be annulled on the ground
of intimidation because here the girl had the legal right
to do what she threatened. (Ruiz v. Atienza, O.G. Aug. 30,
1941, p. 1903)

(b)

A threat to prosecute unless the debtor signs a contract is
not intimidation. (Sotto v. Mariano, [CA.] 36 O.G. 1056)

(c)

If a debtor consents to pay under a threat of recourse to the
courts, the expenses of litigation, he cannot maintain that
his consent was vitiated; BUT it will be otherwise if, passing
beyond the limits of his rights, a creditor has exacted from
a debtor with these same legal threats, a novation of the
contract or a confession of a larger indebtedness. (Jalbuena
656

Art. 1335

956)]

(d)

The right to enforce one’s claim through competent
authority must not by itself constitute an unlawfill act.
Example: A witness to a crime threatens to report the
criminal to the police unless said criminal gives money to
him. This is a clear case of blackmail.

(9) Cases

Tabacalera v. Collector
L-9071, Jan. 31, 1957

FACTS: Tabacalera and Co. entered into a contract of
guaranty, allegedly because the customs investigator threatened
to prevent the sailing of its vessel unless the specific taxes and
other charges on the imports were first paid. After the ship
sailed, the Company, pursuant to the guaranty, made payment.
ISSUE: Was the contract valid?
HELD: Granting that the threat was made, still it was
a justified and legal threat. Moreover, it should be noted that
when the ship had sailed, the duress no longer existed and yet
payment was still made. This evidently is a valid ratification of
the promise.
Berg v. National City Bank
L-9312, Oct 31, 1957

FACTS: Berg signed a compromise agreement with the
National City Bank because the bank had threatened to bring
an action against him and his brother for non-payment, and to
refuse him any further credit facilities.
657

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1336

ISSUE: Is the agreement valid?
HELD: Yes, because the threat of court action was proper
within the realm of law as a means to enforce collection. The
threat to cut off credit is also proper because the bank merely
wants to protect its investment. The court quoted Williston on
Contracts, Vol. 5, pp. 4500-4502: “One element of the early law
of duress continued to exist, however its boundaries may be
otherwise extended. The pressure must be wrongful, and not
all pressure is wrongful. The law provides certain means for
the enforcement of their claims by creditors. It is not duress to
threaten to bring a civil action and to resort to remedies given
by the contract is not such duress as to justify rescission of a
transaction induced thereby, even though, there is no legal right
to enforce the claim, provided the threat is made in good faith;
that is, in the belief that a possible cause of action exists. But
if the threat is made with the consciousness that there is no
real right of action, and the purpose of coercion, a payment or
contract induced thereby is voidable. In the former case, it may
be said that the threatened action is rightful; in the latter case,
it is not.”
(10) Reverential Fear

If a contract is signed merely because of “fear of displeasing
persons to whom obedience and respect are due,” the contract
is still valid, for by itself reverential fear is not wrong.

Sabalvaro v. Erlanger & Galinger, Inc.
64 Phil. 588

FACTS: Sabalvaro signed a contract allegedly because he
was afraid he would be dismissed by his employer, should he
refuse to sign. Was there intimidation if the threat of dismissal
is not proved?
HELD: Since the threat of dismissal was not proved, it
follows that the fear was unfounded; and if he were to allege
that he feared incurring the displeasure of his employers, still
reverential fear does not by itself serve as a ground for the
annulment of a contract.
658

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1336-1337

[NOTE: The same thing may be said of reverential fear in
a client (Turner v. Casabar, 65 Phil. 490), in the absence of an
actual threat.]

Art. 1336. Violence or intimidation shall annul the
obligation, although it may have been employed by a third
person who did not take part in the contract.

COMMENT:
Violence or Intimidation Caused by Third Person
Even if a third person exercised the violence or intimidation,
the contract may be annulled. This is because the consent is still
vitiated. (De Asis v. Buenviaje, [CA..] 45 O.G. 317)
Art. 1337. There is undue influence when a person takes
improper advantage of his power over the will of another,
depriving the latter of a reasonable freedom of choice. The
following circumstances shall be considered: the confidential,
family, spiritual and other relations between the parties, or
the fact that the person alleged to have been unduly influenced
was suffering from mental weakness, or was ignorant or in

financial distress.

Phil. 252)]

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(4) Contracts of Adhesion

Contracts where one party merely signs carefully prepared
contracts by big companies (adhesion contracts or contracts of
adherence, like insurance or transportation contracts) should be
strictly interpreted against the company, and liberally in favor
of the individual, because the individual is “usually helpless to
bargain for better terms.” (See Observations on the New Civil
Code by Justice J.B.L. Reyes, Lawyer’s Journal, Jan. 31, 1951,
p.49)

Art. 1338. There is fraud when, through insidious words
or machinations of one of the contracting parties, the other
is induced to enter into a contract which, without them, he
would not have agreed to.

Cui, et al. v. Cui, et al.
100 Phil. 913

COMMENT:

FACTS: An 83-year-old father executed in favor of one
of his daughters, as well as a son, a deed of sale. At the time

(a)

of the sale, he had lived in the house of said daughter during
the preceding month. (It was his habit to live with his children
at their individual homes, one at a time.) The son, who was
the only lawyer in the family, had been appointed by him six
days before the sale as his attorney-in-fact to manage certain
properties of his. It was proved that at the time of sale, he knew
what he was doing, although three years later, he was declared
an incompetent and placed under guardianship.
ISSUE: Is the sale valid?

HELD: Under the premises, the sale is valid because
the facts proved do not show undue influence or insidious
machinations nor weakness of mind, despite the declaration
later on of subsequent incompetence.
(3) Undue Influence Caused by Third Person

Undue influence exercised by a third party vitiates
consent, just like in the case of violence and intimidation.

Committee on
Codification, March 8, 1951)
660

Art. 1338

(1) Kinds of Fraud

Fraud in the CELEBRATION of the contract (this is fraud
proper):
1)

Dolo causante (or causal fraud): Here, were it not for
the fraud, the other party would not have consented.
(This is the fraud referred to in Art. 1338, Civil
Code.) Effect of this kind of fraud: The contract is

VOIDABLE.

2)

Dolo incidents (or incidental fraud): Here, even
without the fraud the parties would have agreed
just the same, hence the fraud was only incidental in
causing consent. Very likely though, different terms
would have been agreed upon. Effect of this kind of
fraud:The contract is valid, but there can be an action
for damages. (See Woodhouse v. Halili, 93 Phil. 526)
(b) Fraud in the PERFORMANCE of the obligations stipulated
in the contract.
[NOTE: This kind of fraud presupposes the existence
of an already perfected contract.]

[Example: Although real vinegar was sold, what was
really delivered was diluted vinegar.)

(2) Dolo Causante

This is the use of insidious words and machinations by one
of the contracting parties to induce the other party to enter into
a contract, which, without them, he would not have agreed to.

Tuason v. Marquez

seller did not reveal that he had given up the franchise.
The franchise, however, was NOT the determining cause
of the purchase of the plant.

[NOTE: In marriage contracts, dolo causante is
limited to the three cases specified in Art. 86.]
(4) Material and Serious Fraud

Examples:
(a)

A wanted to have himself insured, but because he was
afraid he could not pass the medical examination, he had
another person examined in his place. Here the contract
of insurance is voidable. (Eguaras v. Great Eastern Life
Assurance Co., 33 Phil. 263)

Concealment by the applicant for insurance that he had
suffered from a number of ailment, including incipient
pulmonary tuberculosis, and of the name of the hospital
and of the physician who had treated him. (Musngi v. West
Coast Life Insurance Co., 61 Phil. 864)
(c) Misrepresentation by the vendor of the boundaries of his
land by showing valuable properties not really included in
his title. (Gomez Marino v. Linton, 45 Phil. 652)

(b)

662

Misrepresentation of law. (Gonzales v. Gonzales, Lloret,
Jan. 17, 1922 and R.G. 1652 L. J. May 31, 1938, pp. 466467)

(3) Requisites of Dolo Causante

The fraud must be material and serious, that is, it really
induced the consent. (Art. 1344, Civil Code)
(b) The fraud must have been employed by only one of the
contracting parties, because if both committed fraud, the
contract would remain valid. (See Art. 1344, Civil Code)
(c) There must be a deliberate intent to deceive or to induce;
therefore, misrepresentation in GOOD FAITH is not fraud.
(See Art. 1343, Civil Code)
(d) The other party must have relied on the untrue statement,
and must himself not be guilty of negligence in ascertaining
the truth. (See Songco v. Sellner, 37 Phil. 254)

Art. 1338

ISSUE: May the sale be annulled?
HELD: No, for the absence of the franchise was
immaterial in this particular purchase. Moreover,
ascertainment of the status of the franchise could have
been had by simply inquiring at the Office of the Public
Service Commission.
(e)

The mere insertion in a deed of sale that the vendor is
married when as a matter of fact he is not, is NOT sufficient
evidence of fraud if this fact was not the inducing factor that
led to the sale. (Porciuncula, et al. v. Adamos, L-l 1519-20,
April 30, 1958)

(f)

When a married man conceals deliberately his marriage so
as to be able to carnally have another girl and the latter is
forced to give up her employment because of such family
trouble, he commits actual fraud upon her, and should
therefore be liable for damages. (Silva, et al. v. Peralta,
L-13114, Nov. 25, 1960)

(5) Fault of Party Injured

Azarraga v. Gay
52 Phil. 599

FACTS: A buyer of land before buying was allowed to
investigate for himself the boundaries and the true nature of
the land, even after the seller had told him about it. The seller
did nothing to prevent the investigation from being completed.
Later the buyer brought an action to annul the contract, alleging
that false representations had been made to him.
ISSUE: Will the action prosper?
663

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1338

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: No. The action will not prosper inasmuch as
he (the buyer) had the opportunity to verify for himself the
representations of the seller.
Gregorio Araneta, Inc. v. Tuason de Paterno
91 Phil. 686
FACTS: The vendor was intelligent and well-educated.
She was accustomed to handling her own business affairs.
She was ably assisted by legal counsel. Her son was a leading
businessman.

ISSUE: Under the circumstances, can she ordinarily say
that she was deceived when she entered into a real estate deal?

HELD: No. In a case like this, the party who alleges the
fraud must present full and convincing evidence thereof.
(a)

If one party is able to read and understand, and yet affixes
his signature without reading, his negligence will prevent
the annulment of the contract. (See Ayola v. Valderrama
Lumber Manufacturing Co., Inc., [CA.] 49 O.G. 980)
(b) Supposing both parties had the opportunity to know the
exact nature of the subject matter of the contract, will an
action for annulment due to deceit prosper?

ANS.: No, the action for annulment will not lie. Where the
means of knowledge are at hand and equally available to both
parties, the buyer will not be heard to say he has been deceived.
And if any act is done by the complaining party after discovering
the alleged fraud or mutual mistake toward carrying out the
contract, it shows an irrevocable election to abide by the contract.
(6) Entrance into a Ridiculous Contract

Suppose a man enters into a ridiculous contract because
of a wrong judgment although he is well in possession of his
mental faculties, will the court grant a relief by annulling the
contract?
ANS.: No, for in this case, it was the man’s own fault.
The Supreme Court said: “All men are presumed to be sane
and normal and subject to be moved by substantially the
same motives. When of age and sane, they must take care of
664

।

Art. 1339

themselves. In their relations with others in the business of life,
wits, sense, intelligence, training, ability, and judgment meet
and clash and contest, sometimes with gain and advantage to
all, sometimes to a few only, with loss and injury to others."
“In these contests, men must depend upon themselves,
upon their own abilities. The fact that one may be worsted by
another, of itself, furnishes no cause of complaint. One man
cannot complain because another is more able, or better trained,
or has a better sense of judgment than he has; and when the
two meet on fair field, the inferior cannot murmur if the battle
goes against him. The law furnishes no protection to the inferior
simply because he is inferior, anymore than it protects the
strong, because he is strong. The law furnished protection to
both alike, to one no more or less than the other. It makes no
distinction between the wise and the foolish, the great and the
small, the strong and the weak. The foolish may lose all they
have to the wise; but that does not mean that the law will give
it back to them again.”
“Courts cannot follow every step of one’s life and extricate
him from bad bargains, protect him from unwise investments,
relieve him from one-sided contracts, or annul the effects of
foolish acts. Courts operate not because one person has been
defeated or overcome illegally.”

—

“Men may do foolish things, make ridiculous contracts, use
miserable judgment, and lose money on them indeed, all they
have in the world but not for that alone can the law intervene
and restore. There must be, in addition, a violation of law, the
commission of what the law knows as an actionable wrong,
before the courts are authorized to lay hold of the situation and
remedy it.” (Vales v. Villa, 35 Phil. 769)

Art. 1339. Failure to disclose facts, when there is a duty
to reveal them, as when the parties are bound by confidential
relations, constitutes fraud.

COMMENT:
(1) Failure to Disclose Facts
(a)

Failure to disclose facts (CONCEALMENT) constitutes
FRAUD, when there is a duty to reveal them.
666

Art. 1339

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

There is a duty to reveal in the following cases, for example:
when the parties are bound by confidential relations (Art.
1339) as in the case of partners. (Poss v. Gottlieb, 118 Mise.
318)

Poss v. Gottlieb
118 Mise. 318
FACTS: A and B were real estate partners. A heard
of a possible purchaser of a certain parcel of land owned
by the firm. But A did not inform B. Instead, A persuaded
B to sell to him (A) B‘s share at a nominal amount, after
which A sold the whole parcel at a big profit. B sued A for
damages for alleged deceit. A's defense was that he after
all had not been asked by B about possible purchasers.

HELD: A is liable, for he should not have made any
concealment. Good faith not only requires that a partner
should not make any false concealment, but he also should
abstain from all concealment.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(2) Opponents in a Litigation

There would seem to be no duty to disclose facts, as between
opponents in a litigation for their relations, far from being
friendly or confidential, are openly antagonistic. (Escudero, et
al. v. Flores, et al., 97 Phil. 240)
Art. 1340. The usual exaggerations in trade, when the
other party had an opportunity to know the facts, are not in
themselves fraudulent.

COMMENT:
Usual Exaggerations in Trade
(a)

The maxim“caveat emptor* simply means that a buyer
must be on his guard. It is his duty to check the title of the
seller, otherwise the buyer gets the object at his own risk.

7 Phil. 461

ISSUE: Is the sale to the agent voidable?

(b)

The “usual exaggerations in trade” (dealer’s talk) constitute
tolerated fraud, when the other party had an opportunity
to know the facts.

(c)

The law, according to the Supreme Court in the case of
Songco v. Sellner, 37 Phil. 254, allows considerable latitude
to seller’s statement or dealer’s talk; “and experience
teaches that it is exceedingly risky to accept it at its face
value.” This is particularly so when a dealer refuses to
warrant his estimate. A man who relies upon an affirmation
made by a person whose interest might so readily prompt
him to exaggerate the value of his property, does so at his
own risk. He must therefore take the consequences of his
own imprudence.

(d)

Ordinarily, what does not appear on the face of the written
contract should be regarded as “trader’s talk” or “dealer’s
talk.” (Puyat v. Arco Amusements Co., 72 Phil. 402)

HELD: Yes, because of his fraudulent concealment.
Strong v. Gutierrez Repide
41 Phil. 947
FACTS: A member of the board of directors of a
corporation, through an agent, purchased the stocks of a
certain stockholder without revealing to the latter that
negotiations were being made to enhance the value of the
corporated stock.

ISSUE: Is the purchase fraudulent?

HELD: Yes, in view of the fraudulent concealment.
666

This Article stresses the rule of “caveat emptor* (let the
buyer beware).

Dacusin v. Court of Appeals
80 SCRA 89

Cadwallader and Co. v. Smith, Bell and Co.

said properties at much higher prices.

(a)

(b)

(c)

Art. 1343

Example: A, on buying a watch, was assured by the seller
that it was a good watch, and could run without rewinding
for one week, in the opinion of the seller. This is a mere
expression of opinion that is not fraudulent. But if the seller
was a watch expert, and the only reason why A bought the
watch was this opinion of the seller, the contract is voidable
on the ground of fraud.

If a seller says that in his opinion his land is first class, but
it turns out to be second class, the sale is not fraudulent,
particularly when the buyer had opportunity to examine
the land for himself. (Puato v. Mendoza, 64 Phil. 457)

ANS.:
Force or intimidation by a third person makes the contract
voidable.
(b) Fraud by a third person does not make the contract voidable
unless

(a)

—

1)

the representation has created substantial mistake,
and

2)

the mistake is mutual. (Art. 1342)

In this case, the contract may be annulled, not
principally on the ground of fraud, but on the ground of
error or mistake.

Reason for the rule on an expert’s opinion:

The opinion of an expert is almost in the same category
as a fact, particularly when this expert’s knowledge is relied
upon by the other party.
(2) Problem

X, desiring to buy certain property, hired an expert to
ascertain its true value. But the expert’s opinion turned out
to be wrong and X was, therefore misled. May X ask for the
annulment of the contract?

ANS.: No, because his own expert (and therefore his
employee) committed the error. (See Commission Memorandum
to the Joint Committee on Codification, March 8, 1951)

(2) Query

Is it not better to consider misrepresentation by a third
person as a ground for annulment even if the same has not
resulted in mutual mistake? After all, it cannot be denied that
here, the consent is vitiated just the same.
(3) Case

Hill v. Veloso

FACTS: A and B entered into a contract withX. A’s consent
was obtained only because B had deceived or defrauded him.
May A ask for annulment of the contract with XI

(6) Fraud Is Incompatible With Good Faith

COMMENT:
(1) Requisites for Fraud to Vitiate Consent

Two requisites for fraud as a ground for annulment are
given in this Article:
(a)

the fraud must be serious;

(b)

the parties must not be in pari delicto (mutual guilt),
otherwise, neither party may ask for annulment. The
contract would, therefore, be considered valid. ("See Valdez
v. Sibal, 46 Phil. 930)

(2) Incidental Fraud Does Not Vitiate Consent

Incidental fraud should not be confused with causal fraud.
Incidental fraud is not a cause for annulment.
(3) Types of Fraud Contemplated in the Performance of

Contracts

Jurisprudence has shown that in order to constitute
fraud that provides basis to annul contracts, it must fulfill two
conditions: (1) the fraud must be “dolo causante” or it must be
670

Fraud or malice (dolo) has been defined as a “conscious and
intentional design to evade the normal fulfillment of existing
obligations,” and is this, incompatible with good faith. (Tumibay

Effect: The contract is VOID.
Here, the parties conceal their true agreement.
Effect: The parties are bound to the real or true
agreement except —
a) if the contract should prejudice a third person;
b) or if the purpose is contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public order, or public policy.

(2) Examples

COMMENT:

(a)

(1) ‘Simulation of a Contract’ Defined

It is the process of intentionally deceiving others by
producing the appearance of a contract that really does not
exist (absolute simulation) or which is different from the true
agreement (relative simulation). (See TS, Dec. 19, 1951)
(2) Requisites for Simulation

(a)

An outward declaration of will different from the will of
the parties;

(b)

The false appearance must have been intended by mutual
agreement-,

(c)

The purpose is to deceive third persons.

Absolutely Simulated:
As a joke, A and B executed a deed of sale although
they did not intend to be bound at all by the contract.
[NOTE: An absolutely simulated contract is inexistent
and VOID. (De Belen v. Collector of Customs, 46 Phil. 241)}

(b)

Relatively Simulated:
Although a deed of sale was made, the parties really
intended a donation but they wanted to conceal the
existence of the donation (simulation of the NATURE of
the contract); or a true sale at a different price had really
been agreed upon (simulation of the CONTENT or TERMS
of the contract).
[NOTE: Third persons should not be prejudiced;
therefore, as to them, the apparent or ostensible contract
is the one valid. Reason: The contracting parties are in
estoppel, and they should be penalized for their deception.}

Art. 1348. An absolutely simulated or fictitious contract
is void. A relative simulation, when it does not prejudice a
third person and is not intended for any purpose contrary
to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy
binds the parties to their real agreement.

(4) Case

Edilberto Cruz and Simpliciano Cruz v. Bancom
Finance Corp. (Union Bank of the Phils.)
GR 147788, March 19, 2002
FACTS: Although the Deed of Sale between petitioners and
Candelaria Sanchez stipulated a consideration of P150.000, there
was actually no exchange of money between them. Respondent
never offered any evidence to refute the foregoing. On the
contrary, it even admitted that the stipulated consideration of
P150.000 in the Deed of Sale had never been actually paid by
Sanchez to petitioners.

HELD: The Deed of Sale were absolutely simulated, hence,
null and void. (Francisco v. Francisco- Alfonso, GR 138774,
March 8, 2001) Thus, it did not convey any rights that could
ripen into a valid titles. (Velasquez v. CA, 345 SCRA 468 [2000])
There being no valid real estate mortgage, there could also be
no valid foreclosure or valid auction sale, either. At bottom,
respondent cannot be considered either as a mortgagee or as a
purchaser in good faith. This being so, petitioners would be in the
same position as they were before they executed the simulated
Deed of Sale in favor of Sanchez; they are still the owners of the
property. (GSIS v. CA, 287 SCRA 204 [1998])
[NOTE: A deed of sale, in which the stated consideration
had not, in fact, been paid, was a false contract, i.e., void ab initio.
(Rongarilla v. CA, 294 289 [1998]) A contract of purchase and
sale is null and void and produces no effect whatsoever where it
appears that [the] same is without cause or consideration which
should have been the motive thereof, or the purchase price which
appears thereon as paid but which, in fact, has never been paid
by the purchaser to the vendor. ( Ocejo v. Flores, 80 Phil. 921
{1920})]

A duly executed contract enjoys the presumption of validity,
and the party assailing its regularity has the burden to prove
its simulation.

In the case at bar, simulation has been described by the
Supreme Court "... as the declaration of a fictitious will, made deliberately
by mutual agreement of the parties, in order to produce
the appearances of a juridical act which does not exist or
is different from that which was really executed, for the
purpose of deceiving third persons.”
(6) ‘Absolutely Simulated’ Contract Distinguished from a

‘Relatively Simulated’ Contract

QUERY

How is an “absolutely simulated” contract distinguished
from a “relatively simulated” contract?

ANS: An absolutely simulated (or fictitious) contract is void
while a relatively simulated contract when it does not prejudice
a third person and is not intended for any purpose contrary to
law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy - binds
the parties to their real agreement.
Section 2

OBJECT OF CONTRACTS
Art. 1347. All things which are not outside the commerce
of men, including future things, may be the object of a

be the object of contracts.

No contract may be entered into upon future inheritance
except in cases expressly authorized by law.

675

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1347

All services which are not contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public order or public policy may likewise be the
object of a contract.
COMMENT:
(1) Object (Subject Matter) of a Contract

The object of a contract is really to create or to end
obligations which, in turn, may involve things or services. Hence,
elliptically, it may be said that the object of a contract is a thing
or a service.
(2) Requisites
(a)

the thing or service must be within the commerce of man;

(b)

must be transmissible;

(c)

must not be contrary to law, morals, good customs, public
order, or public policy;

(d)

must not be impossible (Art. 1348, Civil Code);

(e)

must be determinate as to its kind or determinable without
the need of a new contract or agreement. (Art. 1349, Civil
Code)

(3) Within the Commerce of Man

If the object is outside the commerce of man, such as
sidewalks (Muyot v. De la Fuente, [CA.] 48 O.G. 4866) or public
plazas (Mun. of Cavite v. Rojas, 30 Phil. 602), or public bridges,
they cannot be the object of contracts of alienation (but may be
the object, for example, of a contract for repair). Taxes are fixed
by law, and are not subject to contract between the taxpayer
and tax officer, except when there is an actual compromise.
(Coll, of Int. Rev. v. Ellen Wood McGrath, L-12710, L-12721,
Feb. 28, 1961) The right to present one’s candidacy for a public
office cannot be the object of a contract. Hence, a defeated
candidate in a party convention who has previously agreed not
to run for public office (if defeated in such convention) cannot be
successfully sued for breach of the agreement. (Saura v. Sindico,

Leonardo Navarro v. Luis L. Lardizabal, et al.
L-25361, Sept. 28, 1968

FACTS: Juanita Cachero, lawful holder of a stall in
the public market in Baguio City allowed Leonardo Navarro
to occupy the same for more than six months. Navarro then
formally applied for the award of the stall to him. The City
Market Committee postponed indefinitely the awarding of the
stall upon the protest of a certain D.B. Baton. Navarro sued for
prohibition (to prohibit the Baguio City officials from delaying
the award).
ISSUE: Will the suit prosper?
HELD: The suit will not prosper, for Navarro has not shown
that he already has a legal right to the stall, his application
being merely pending. The right to lease and occupy a stall in
a public market is not a common right, but a purely statutory
privilege, governed by laws and ordinances. (Samson v. Fugoso,
45 O.G. 300) The occupancy of the stall cannot be the subject
of a valid contract as between the authorized stallholder and
his transferee, unless the agreement is approved by the City
authorities concerned.

GR 51291, May 29, 1984
A probate court has NO jurisdiction to order the sale of
properties belonging to registered owners (with Certificates of
Title), if said owners are not parties to the proceedings, and this
is so even if the properties had been included in the inventory
submitted by the administrator of the estate.
(4) Transmissible

All rights which are not intransmissible may be the object
of contracts. But strictly political rights (like the right to vote)
or strictly personal rights (like parental authority) cannot be
the subject of a contract.
(5) Not Contrary to Law, Morals, etc.
(a)

Future things may be the object of a contract; thus, the
future harvest of sugar cane in a specific field may be sold;
677

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1347

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ANS.: No, because the object of the contract
here is really future inheritance, and the particular
contract in this case is not one of those authorized by
law regarding inheritance. (Tordilla v. Tordilla, 60

but by express provision of law, said future property may
not be donated.
(b)

Future inheritance (one where the source of property is still
alive) cannot be the subject of a contract except:
1)

in the case of marriage settlements. (See Art. 130,
Civil Code);

2)

in the case of partitions of property inter vivos by the
deceased. (See Art. 1080, Civil Code)
[NOTE: Future inheritance is any property or
right not in existence or capable of determination, at
the time of the contract, that a person may in the
future acquire by succession. (Maria Gervacio Blas,
et al. v. Rosalinda Santos, et al., L-14070, March 29,
1961)]

(c)

Illustrative Questions:
1)

When his father died, but before delivery of the
property to him, a son sold his share of the property
inherited. Is the sale valid?

ANS.: Yes, the sale is valid. The inheritance here
is not future inheritance, but existing inheritance,
although as yet undelivered. Ownership is transferred
automatically to the heir upon the death of the
decedent. Said the Supreme Court: “The properties
of an existing inheritance cannot be considered as
another’s property with relation to the heirs who,
through a fiction of law, continue the personality of
the owner. Nor do they have the character of future
property because the predecessor in interest having
already died, his heirs acquired a right to succeed
him from the moment of his death. An inheritance
already existing, which is no longer future from the
moment of death of the predecessor, may legally be
the object of contract.” ( Osorio v. Osorio and Inchausti
Steamship Co., 41 Phil. 513)
2)

While his father was still alive, A sold to B the
property he (A) expected to receive from his father.
Is the contract valid?
678

Art. 1347

Phil. 162)
3)

Some future heirs divided the property they expected
to inherit from their mother, at a time when she was
still alive. Is such partition of property valid?
ANS.: No. This is a contract relating to a future
inheritance (for the mother is still alive) and does not
come under the category of those contracts authorized
by law concerning future inheritance. The owner (the
mother) could have made a partition among the heirs,
but since the partition was made here not by her,
but by the heirs, the same is void, under the second
paragraph of Art. 1271 of the old Civil Code. (Now the
second paragraph of Art. 1347 of the New Civil Code)
(Arroyo v. Gerona, 58 Phil. 226)

(6) No Extension after Expiration

Gindoy v. Tapucar
76 SCRA 31

If a lease has expired, the trial court can no longer extend
the same without the consent of both lessor and lessee.
(7) Human Blood Is Not an Object of Contract

The human blood, like other parts of the human body,
cannot be considered object of contracts (Art. 1347, Civil
Code) because they are outside the commerce of men. As such,
the extraction, collecting, and selling of human blood by any
individual or agency (e.g., People’s Blood Bank) is an aspect of
the medical profession and should not be considered a taxable
entity for business tax purposes.
The word “donation” instead of “selling” should be used
the euphemisms for the act of “giving away” or “transferring
another any part of the human body for scientific purposes,
save life or to advance the cause of medical science.” “Sale” of
human blood is not taxable activity for business tax purposes.

object of contracts.

COMMENT:
(1) Impossible Things or Services

Art. 1350

If the object is not determinate or determinable, the
contract is void for want of an essential requisite the
object of the contract.
(c) If A promised to give B this (blank), it is clear that there
can be no obligation here.
(d) But if A sold to B the future (2006) harvest in A’s field for
a definite price, the contract is valid for there is no need of
a new agreement.
(b)

.

Impossibility may be:

—

(a)

because of the nature of the transaction or because of the
law;

(b)

absolute (objectively impossible) (here, NO ONE can do it);

Section 3

(c)

relative (subjectively impossible) (here, the particular
debtor cannot comply).

CAUSE OF CONTRACTS

[NOTE: Generally, the impossibility referred to by the law
is absolute impossibility.]
[NOTE: If a blind man enters into a contract which
requires the use of his eyesight, the contract is void although
in this particular case, we have only a relative impossibility. (8
Manresa 685) This is because here, the relative impossibility is

not merely temporary.]

(2) Impossibility Not to Be Confused from Mere Difficulty

Impossibility must not be confused with difficulty. Hence,
a showing of mere inconvenience, unexpected impediments, or
increased expenses is not enough. (Castro, et al. v. Longa, 89
Phil. 581)

Art. 1350. In onerous contracts the cause is understood
to be, for each contracting party, the prestation or promise
of a thing or service by the other; in remuneratory ones, the
service or benefit which is remunerated; and in contracts of
pure beneficence, the mere liberality of the benefactor.

COMMENT:
(1) 'Cause’ Defined
It is the essential and impelling reason why a party
assumes an obligation. (8 Manresa 677) Strictly speaking, there
is no cause of a contract, but there is a cause for an obligation.
Private Development Corp, of the
Phils, v. LAC & Ernesto C. del Rosario

GR 73198, Sept. 2, 1992

Art. 1349. The object of every contract must be determinate
as to its kind. The fact that the quantity is not determinate
shall not be obstacle to the existence of the contract, provided
it is possible to determine the same, without the need of a new
contract between the parties.
।

COMMENT:
Object of the Contract
(a)

Inasmuch as the loan agreement herein was entered into
on May 21, 1974, the prevailing law applicable is Act 2655,
otherwise known as the Usury Law, as amended by PD 116,
which took effect on Jan. 29, 1974.

The object must be determinate or determinable (without
need of a new agreement).
680

Section 2 of Act 2655 provides that “[n]o person or
corporation shall directly or indirectly take or receive money or
other property, real or personal, or choses in action, a higher
rate of interest or greater sum or value including commissions,
premiums, fines and penalties, for the loan or renewal thereof
or forbearance of money, goods or credit, where such loan or
renewal or forbearance is secured in whole or in part by a
681

Art. 1350

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

mortgage upon real estate, the title to which is duly registered or
by a document conveying such real estate at an interest, higher
than twelve percent per annum."

The Usury Law, therefore, as amended by PD 116, fixed
all interest rates for all loans with maturity of more than 360
days at 12% per annum including premiums, fines and penalties.
It is to be noted that PDCP was charging penalties at the rate
of 2% per month or an effective rate of 24% per annum on the
peso loan and 1/2% per month or an effective 6% per annum on
the foreign currency loan. It is, therefore, very clear that PDCP
has been charging and imposing interests in violation of the
prevailing usury laws. Be it noted further that in the beginning,
PDCP was charging a total of 19% interest per annum on the
peso loan and 18 3/4% on the foreign currency loan. Since the
penalty charge was increased to 2% per month with regard to
the peso loan, PDCP began charging a total of 42% per annum on
the peso loan, clearly in violation of the Usury Law. For instance,
Davao Timber Corporation obtained a loan of P4.4 million and
has paid a total of about P3 million, the remaining balance on
the principal debt left unpaid is about Pl.4 million, to which
respondents must still pay the petitioner. The law should not
be interpreted to mean forfeiture of the principal loan as that
would be unjustly enriching the borrower. The unpaid principal
debt still stands and remains valid but the stipulation as to
the usurious interest is void; consequently, the debt is to be
considered without stipulation as to the interest.
In a simple loan with stipulation of usurious interest, the
prestation of the debtor to pay the principal debt, which is the
cause of the contract (Art. 1350, Civil Code), is not illegal. The
illegality lies only as to the prestation to pay the stipulated
interest; hence, being separable, the latter only should be
deemed void, since it is the only one that is illegal. Ilie foregoing
interpretation is reached with the philosophy of usury legislation
in mind; to discourage stipulations on usurious interest,
said stipulations are treated as wholly void, so that the loan
becomes one without stipulation as to the payment of interest.
It should not, however, be interpreted to mean forfeiture even
of the principal, for this would uiyustly enrich the borrower at
the expense of the lender. Furthermore, penal sanctions are
available against a usurious lender, as a further deterrence
682

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1360

to usury. The principal debt remaining without stipulation for
payment of interest can thus be recovered by judicial action.
(2) 'Cause’ and ‘Subject Matter* Distinguished

The difference is only a matter of viewpoint in some way,
because what may be the subject matter for one party will be
the cause or consideration for the other party.
Example: A is obliged to sing at a concert, in return for
which she will receive a car from B.
Regarding A, the subject matter is the singing; the cause
is the car.
Regarding B, the subject matter is the car; the cause is the
singing.

Hence, we can form this general conclusion: In reciprocal
contracts, the subject matter for one is the cause for the other,
and vice versa.
(3) BAR QUESTION

If a particular piano is sold for P500,000 what is the object
and what is the cause?

ANS.: There are two schools of thought here.
(a) According to Manresa, for the seller the object is the piano
and the cause is the price; for the buyer the object is the
price and the cause is the piano.
(b) According to others, for both the seller and the buyer, there
is just one object, namely, the piano. The cause for the seller
is the price; the cause for the buyer is the delivery of the

piano.
(4) Classification of Contracts as to Cause
(a)

—

here the cause is, for each contracting party,
the prestation or promise of a thing or service by the other.

Onerous

Example: contract of sale
(b)

—

Remuneratory the past service or benefit which by itself
is a recoverable debt.
683

[NOTE: In a remuneratory donation., the past service
or debt is not by itself a recoverable debt. (See Art. 726,

Civil Code)]
(c) Gratuitous (or contracts of pure beneficence)
cause is the mere liability of the benefactor.

Here generally, the cause is the same as the cause for
the principal contract of loan. (China Banking Corporation v.

of guaranty is gratuitous, unless there is stipulation to the
contrary. (Art. 2048, Civil Code) Sometimes, however, some
material consideration may be given. (Standard Oil Co. v.
Arenas, op. cit.)
(7) Moral Obligation as a Valid Cause of a Civil Obligation

A moral obligation may be the cause of a civil obligation.
(Villaroel v. Estrada, 71 Phil. 140) Of course, if the moral
obligation really does not exist, there is no valid cause, as
when the promise was made on the erroneous belief that one
was morally responsible for the failure of a certain particular
enterprise. (Fisher v. Robb, 69 Phil. 101)

Phil. Guaranty, Inc. v. Dino, et al.
L-10547, Jan. 31, 1958

FACTS: The Phil. Guaranty Co. put up a bond for Dino
in a court action. In turn, Manalastas executed a mortgage in
favor of the Phil. Guaranty Co. as counter-guaranty for Dino’s

bond.

ISSUE: Does the mortgage executed by Manalastas have

any cause or consideration?

HELD: Yes. The cause was the execution of the bond
by the corporation in favor of Dino. It is not necessary that
such consideration should redound directly to the benefit of
Manalastas; it is enough that it be favorable to Dino.
Garrido v. Perez Cardenas
60 Phil. 964

Where one of the signers of a promissory note was
indebted to the payee in the amount of P2.000 and to secure
its payment the defendant signed the note together with said
debtor in solidum, the said debt is sufficient consideration for
the execution of the note as to the defendant.

L-16114, March 24, 1961

FACTS: Mactal gave Melegrito Pl,770 for the purchase of
palay in behalf of the former, with the obligation of returning
the amount within 10 days, if not spent for said purpose. The
agent neither bought the palay nor returned the money. Mactal
thus accused him of estafa. Melegrito persuaded Mactal to drop
the case, and in turn he (Melegrito) executed a promissory note
in favor of the other for the amount involved.
ISSUE: Is the promissory note valid?
HELD: Yes, for its cause or consideration was not the
dismissal of the estafa case, but the pre-existing debt of Melegrito
the amount that had been given to him.

(8) Shocking Cause or Consideration

Javier v. Vda. de Cruz
80 SCRA 343

A supposed sale by a dying man of a parcel of land
consisting of more than 18 hectares to his houseboy for only P700
is shocking to the conscience and void. Besides, the thumbmark
of the seller on the deed cannot have been affixed voluntarily by

said seller.

Art. 1351

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ong v. Ong
GR 67888, Oct. 8, 1985

In deeds of conveyance that adhere to the Anglo-Saxon
practice, it is not unusual to state that the consideration given
is Pl.00, although the actual consideration may be more. A onepeso consideration may be suspicious; this alone does not justify
one to infer that the buyers are not buyers in good faith and
for value. Neither does such inference warrant one to conclude
that the sale is void ab initio. Bad faith and inadequacy of
monetary consideration do not render a conveyance inexistent.
The assignor’s liberality could be a sufficient cause for a valid

contract.

Art. 1351. The particular motives of the parties in entering
into a contract are different from the cause thereof.

COMMENT:
(1) Motives of the Parties for Entering into a Contract

Example: I buy a gun from a store for P50.000 because I
want to kill myself. The cause of the contract is the gun (for me);
the money (for the seller). My motive, however, is the killing of
myself. Motives do not enter at all in the validity or invalidity
of cause or consideration.

be associated. These circumstances may constitute the motive
which induces the purchase, but the real consideration of the
purchase is the money which passed. With one’s motives the
law cannot deal in civil actions of this character, while with
the consideration the law is always concerned.” (De Jesus v. G.

Urrutia & Co., 33 Phil. 717)

(4) Illegal Cause Distinguished from Illegal Motive

An illegal cause makes a contract void; an illegal motive
does not necessarily render the transaction void. Example: If I
buy a knife to kill X, the purchase is still valid. (See Gonzales, et
al. v. Trinidad, et al., 67 Phil. 682) But if the purpose is to stifle
a criminal prosecution, the contract is void. (Reyes v. Gonzales,
[C.A.] 45 O.G. 831 and 8 Manresa 627)
Art. 1352. Contracts without cause, or with unlawful
cause, produce no effect whatsoever. The cause is unlawful
if it is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or
public policy.

COMMENT:
(1) Requisites for Cause
(a)

The motive of a person may vary although he enters into
the same kind of contract; the cause is always the same.
(b) The motive may be unknown to the other, the cause is
always known.
(c) The presence of motive cannot cure the absence of cause.

It must be true (not false);
(c) It must be lawful (not contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public order, or public policy).

(b)

(2) Existing Cause
(a)

(3) Statement of Distinction by the Supreme Court

“The motives which impel one to a sale or purchase are not
always the consideration (cause) of the contract as that term is
understood in law. One may purchase an article not because it is
cheap, for in fact, it may be dear, but because he may have some
particular use to which it may be put because of a particular
quality which that article has or the relation to which it will
686

It must be present (at the time the contract was entered
into);

(2) Motive Distinguished from Cause
(a)

Art. 1352

If there is no cause whatsoever, the contract is VOID. Thus,
a fictitious sale is VOID. (Navarro v. Diego, [CAJ 40 O.G.
2106)

(b)

Just because the seller was not the owner of the thing sold,
it does not mean that there was lack of cause, for after all,
there is a warranty (See Levy v. Johnson, 44 Phil. 463); nor
does failure to pay the price result in a lack of cause. (De

Carantes v. Court of Appeals
L-33360, April 25, 1977

FACTS: The heirs of a deceased person assigned in 1939
their “Right to Inheritance” in favor of a co-heir in consideration
of the sum of Pl.00 and in further consideration of the fact
that while the deceased was still alive, he had orally expressed
that the assignee co-heir was actually the rightful owner of the
property being assigned to him. It was alleged later, in an action
to nullify the assignment, that the deed of assignment was void,
there being no consideration therefor, and that the action to have
the deed declared void does not prescribe because the deed itself
was void.
ISSUES: Was the contract of assignment valid? Does this
kind of action prescribe?
HELD:
(a) The contract of assignment is VALID, there being sufficient
the Pl.00 consideration and
consideration therefor
the fact that the deceased had previously recognized the
assignee to be the rightful owner of the property.
(b) Since the contract is not void, an action to declare its nullity
may prescribe.

(4) True Cause

If the cause is false, the contract is not valid unless some
other cause which is lawful really exists. (See Art. 1353, Civil

Code)

(5) Lawful Cause
(a)

If the cause is unlawful, the transaction is null and void.

(b)

Thus, a contract to stifle criminal prosecution for theft is
void because this is manifestly contrary to public policy
and the due administration of justice. (Arroyo v. Berwin,
36 Phil. 386)

A promissory note to cover a gambling debt (Palma v.
Canizares, 1 Phil. 602), or to cover accumulated usurious
debts, is VOID. (Mulet v. People, 73 Phil. 63)
(d) A promise of marriage based on sexual intercourse is based
on an illegal cause. (Batarra v. Marcos, 7 Phil. 156)
(e) If a person claims that some parts of a contract are illegal
but the rest are valid, he has the burden of showing which

parts are supported by a lawful cause; otherwise, the whole
contract shall be considered VOID. (Lichauco v. Martinez,
6 Phil. 694)

(3) BAR PROBLEM

On Jan. 5, A sold and delivered his truck together with
the corresponding certificate of public convenience to B for the
sum of Pl.6 million, payable within 60 days. Two weeks after
the sale, and while the certificate of public convenience was
still in the name of A, the certificate was revoked by the Land
Transportation Commission through no fault of A. Upon the
expiration of the 60-day period, A demanded payment of the
price from B. B refused to pay, alleging that the certificate of
public convenience which was the main consideration of the sale
no longer existed. Is the contention of B tenable?

ANS.: No, for the certificate was in existence at the time of
the perfection of the contract. Its subsequent revocation is of no

While an absolutely simulated contract can have no effect,

1957)

,

Liguez v. Court of Appeals, et al.
L-11240, Dec. 18, 1957

FACTS: Salvador P. Lopez, a married man, gave Conchita
Liguez, a 15-year-old girl, a donation of land so that she would
689

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1362

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

have sexual relations with him and so that her parents would
allow them to live together. After Lopez’s death, Conchita
sought to get the land from his heirs, but said heirs refused on
the ground that the cause or consideration of the donation was
illegal, and that therefore the donation should be considered
null and void. Conchita contended that while the motive might
have been immoral, still the cause “liberality” was proper,
and that therefore the donation should be considered valid.

—

(unreasonable delay in bringing a court action); and

therefore she should not recover the property.
In a decision promulgated Feb. 12, 1958 (Liguez v. Court
of Appeals, et al., L-11240), the court answered one by one
the abovementioned contentions:

—

(a)

Just because Lopez is estopped from questioning the
legality of the donation, it does not mean that his heirs
cannot question its validity;
(c) Since both parties are equally guilty, they are in pari delicto
(equal guilt), therefore the law should leave them as they
are; therefore, Conchita, who has not been given actual
possession of the property, cannot claim the same;
(d) Finally, since Conchita has long delayed her recovery
of the property, she is now guilty of estoppel by laches
690

(c)

The pari delicto rule cannot apply because the guilt
of a minor (Conchita was only 15) cannot be judged
with equal severity as the guilt of an adult. Minors
occupy a privileged position under the law.

(d)

The rule of estoppel by laches cannot apply in this case
against Conchita; otherwise, we would be prevented
from enforcing the principle that a party to an illegal
contract cannot recover what he has given pursuant
thereto. The latter rule is of superior public policy.]

'

The donation being null and void, it should have no effect;
therefore, Conchita cannot get the land;

(b)

There are two kinds of void donations: those made

without the proper formalities (inexistent contract),
and those which are illegal. The first kind is inexistent
in law, and is open to attack even by the parties
thereto; but the second kind is not inexistent, it is
illegal, and under the Civil Code, neither party may
invoke its unlawful character as a ground for relief.
(b) If Lopez cannot question, his heirs cannot also
question for they can have no better right than the
predecessor whom they replaced. If at all the heirs
can question, it should be on some other ground, like
its being inofficious, for instance (one that would
prejudice their legitime).

HELD: The donation was null and void. While it is true that
motive differs from cause, still a contract that is conditioned upon
the attainment of an immoral motive should be considered void,
for here motive may be regarded as cause when it predetermines
the purposes of the contract. Here, Lopez would not have
conveyed the property in question had he known that Liguez
would not cohabit with him; it follows that the cohabitation
was an implied condition to the donation, and being unlawful,
the donation itself must be considered unlawful. Moreover, it
cannot be said here that the donation was a “contract of pure
beneficence" or a contract designed solely and exclusively for the
welfare of the beneficiary. Indeed, the donation was made both
to benefit Conchita and to gratify his own sexual desires. We
have thus seen that the donation was immoral. Nevertheless,
had Lopez been alive, he could not have invoked the immorality
of the donation because it was he who was at fault; thus Conchita
is entitled to the land.
[NOTE: The losers, the heirs of Lopez, filed a motion for
reconsideration on the following grounds:
(a)

Art. 1352

(6) Effect If the Cause Is Illegal
(a)

If one party is innocent he cannot be compelled to perform
his obligation, and he may recover what he has already
given. (See Art. 1411, Civil Code)

(b)

If both parties are guilty, in general, neither can sue
the other, the law leaving them as they are. But certain
exceptions exist. (See Arts. 1414, 1416, etc., Civil Code)

ISSUE: Can recovery be made?
HELD: No recovery can be made because the cause of

COMMENT:
Presumption That Cause Exists
(a)

It is necessary that the cause must exist, BUT it is not
necessary to STATE the cause in the contract. Reason: It is
presumed that the cause EXISTS and is LAWFUL, unless
the debtor proves the contrary. (See Radio Corp. v. Roa, 62

Under the Statute of Frauds, certain agreements have to

a defendant in the instant case, the husband’s liability cannot

ANS.: A because under the law, the presumption is
that the cause is lawful. (See Rodriguez v. Martinez, 6 Phil.

Art. 1353. The statement of a false cause in contracts shall
render them void, if it should not be proved that they were
founded upon another cause which is true and lawful.

COMMENT:
Statement of a False Cause

Just because the cause stated is false does not necessarily
mean that the contract is void. Reason: The parties are
given a chance to show that a cause really exists, and that
said cause is true and lawful.

with a statement of a false cause is not void, but merely
revocable or voidable. (Concepcion v. Sta. Ana, 87 Phil.

itself, does not invalidate a contract. But if A had sold it
only for this amount because of fraud or mistake or undue
influence, the contract may be annulled. Said the Court:

Art. 1356. Contracts shall be obligatory, in whatever form
they may have been entered into, provided all the essential
requisites for their validity are present. However, when the
law requires that a contract be in some form in order that it
may be valid or enforceable, or that a contract be proved in a
certain way, that requirement is absolute and indispensable.
In such cases, the rights of the parties stated in the following
article cannot be exercised.

COMMENT:
(1) Generally, Form Is Not Required

In general, form does not matter for the validity of a
contract. It is enough that there be consent, subject matter,
and cause. This rule applies, however, to CONSENSUAL
CONTRACTS.
[NOTE:
(a)

(b)

FORMAL CONTRACTS (SOLEMN CONTRACTS) require
a certain specified form, in addition to consent, subject
matter, and cause. (Example: A donation of real property
must be in a public instrument in order to be valid, even
as between the parties.)
REAL CONTRACTS require DELIVERY to be valid as a
real contract even as between the parties, in addition to
consent, subject matter, and cause.]

Marlene Dauden-Hernaez v.
Hon. Walfrido de los Angeles, et cd.
L-27010, April 30, 1969

FACTS: Marlene Dauden-Hernaez, a movie
actress, sued a movie company (the Hollywood Far East
Productions, Inc.) and its President and General Manager
696

balance allegedly due her for her services as a star in two
movies, and to recover damages. The contract was an ORAL
one. The lower court dismissed the case on the ground that
under Art. 1358 of the Civil Code, since the contract price
exceeded P500, the same should have been evidenced by
a written instrument.
ISSUE: Was the dismissal proper?
HELD: No, the dismissal was not proper. Generally,
under Art. 1356 all contracts are valid, regardless of form.
There are only two exceptions — first, when the contractual
form is needed for VALIDITY as in the case of a donation
of real property which needs a public instrument; secondly,
when form is needed for ENFORCEABILITY under the
Statute of Frauds. The contract for her services falls under
neither exception. The contracts covered by Art. 1358 (such
as her contract) are binding and enforceable by action
or suit despite the absence of any writing because said
article nowhere provides that the absence of written form
will make the agreement invalid or unenforceable. In the
matter of form, the contractual system of our Civil Code
still follows that of the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 and of
the "Ordenamiento de Alcala” of upholding the spirit and
intent of the parties over formalities; hence, generally, oral
contracts are valid and enforceable.
Duque v. Domingo
80 SCRA 654

It is difficult to believe that registered land has been
partitioned orally, for to affect third parties any transaction
affecting registered land should be evidenced by a public
instrument (so that the document will be a registrable
deed).

[NOTE: As between the parties, however, the oral
partition may be regarded as valid.]

(4) Some Problems
(a)

A donated real property to B in a private instrument. B
accepted the donation. Is the donation valid?

(2) When Form Is Important

ANS.: No, because the donation was not made in a
public instrument. (Camagay v. Lagera, 7 Phil. 397)

Form may be important:
(b)

Real property was donated in a public instrument but
acceptance was made in a private instrument. Is the
donation valid?

(a)

For VALIDITY (This is true in formal or solemn contracts.)

(b)

For ENFORCEABILITY [This is true for the agreements
enumerated under the Statute of Frauds, but of course
this requirement may be waived by acceptance of benefits
(partial) or by failure to object to the presentation of oral
(parol) evidence. (See Art. 1403, Civil Code)]

ANS.: No, because both the giving and the accepting
must be in a public instrument. (See Abellara v. Balanag,
37 Phil. 865)

For CONVENIENCE (This is true for the contracts
enumerated for example under Art. 1385, Civil Code).

Civil Code cannot be availed of.]
(a)

Donations of real property (these require a public

(b)

Donations of personal property (these require a written

748, Civil Code)

(c)

Stipulation to pay interest on loans, interest for the USE
of the money (said stipulation must be in writing).

(d)

Transfer of large cattle (this requires the transfer of the
certificate of registration). (Sec. 523, Rev. Adm. Code)

(e)

Sale of land through an agent (here, the authority of the
agent must be in writing; otherwise, the sale is null and
void). (Art. 1874, Civil Code)

(f)

Contracts of antichresis (here the principal loan, and the
interest if any, must be specified in writing; otherwise, the
contract of antichresis is void). (Art. 1773, Civil Code)

1)

ANS.:
If the land had been delivered or the money has been
paid, the sale is completely valid.

[NOTE: Although the Statute of Frauds requires
this contract to be in writing, still said statute does
not apply to executed or partially executed contracts.]
2)

If the land has not yet been delivered and the price
has not yet been paid, the sale is unenforceable, that
is, neither party may be compelled by court action to
perform unless the defense of the Statute of Frauds
is waived.

(5) Case

Gallardo v. LAC
GR 67742, Oct. 29, 1987
FACTS: Meliton claims that on Aug. 10, 1937, Pedro sold
to him (Meliton) in a private document, an unnotarized deed of
sale, allegedly signed by Pedro, now deceased, the property in
question. Based on the private document of sale, the Original
699

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1366

Certificate of Title was cancelled and a New Certificate of
Title issued in the name of Meliton. The office of the Register
of Deeds where the records were kept were destroyed. So, by
an affidavit of reconstitution, dated Dec. 2, 1958, and upon
presentation of the Owner’s Duplicate Certificate of Title, the
title was administratively reconstituted and the Register of
Deeds issued the corresponding transfer certificate of title in
the name of Meliton. On Nov. 17, 1976, Marta, the daughter of
Pedro, executed and filed an affidavit of adverse claim with the
Office of the Register of Deeds. On December 9, 1976, a deed of
conveyance and release of claim was prepared which provided
that Marta is withdrawing the adverse claim. But Marta refused
to sign the affidavit of quitclaim.
Meliton sued Marta by filing a complaint for quieting of
title. Marta countered that the deed of sale be declared null and
void ab initio. The trial court declared the deed of sale of August
10, 1937 as well as the reconstituted certificate of title of Meliton
void ab initio. The Intermediate Appellate Court affirmed the
trial court. The Supreme Court sustained both the trial and
appellate court.

HELD: The deed of sale is not registerable under the
Land Registration Act. True, a private conveyance of registered
property is valid between the parties. But the only right
the buyer of registered property in a private document is to
compel through court processes the seller to execute a deed of
conveyance sufficient in law for registration purposes.
Meliton’s reliance on Art. 1356 of the Civil Code is
unfortunate. The general rule enunciated in Art. 1356 is that
contracts are obligatory, in whatever form they may have been
entered, provided all the essential requisites for their validity
are present. The next sentence provides the exception, which
requires a contract to be in some form when the law so requires
for validity or enforceability. Said law in Sec. 127 of Act 496
requires that the conveyance be executed “before the judge of a
court of record or clerk of a court of record or a notary public or
a justice of the peace, who shall certify such acknowledgment
substantially in form next hereinafter stated.” Such law was
involved here. The Register of Deed’s act in allowing the
registration of the private deed of sale was authorized and did
not validate the defective private document of sale.

(6) QUERY

Does a contract need to be in writing in order to be obliga¬
tory and effective?

ANS: No, unless the law specifically requires so. (Federal
Builders, Inc. v. Power Factors, Inc., 820 SCRA 78 [2017])
(7) The Law Does Not Relieve a Party from the Effects of a

Disastrous Contract

Ku Kuen Chua v. Colarite Marketing Corp
830 SCRA 81
(2017)

It is settled that the law does not relieve a party from the
effects of an unwise, foolish, or disastrous contract, entered into
with all the required formalities and with the required formali¬
ties and with full awareness of what he was doing, and courts
have no power to relieve parties from obligations voluntarily
assumed, simply because their contracts turned out to be dis¬
astrous deals or unwise investments.

Art. 1357. If the law requires a document or other special
form, as in the acts and contracts enumerated in the following
article, the contracting parties may compel each other to
observe that form, once the contract has been perfected. This
right may be exercised simultaneously with the action upon
the contract.

COMMENT:
(1) Right of One Party to Compel the Other to Execute the

Necessary Form

The Article applies only when form is needed only for

convenience, not for validity or enforceability.
In other words, before the contracting parties may be
compelled to execute the needed form, it is essential that the
contract be:
(a)

perfected (valid) (Art. 1357);

(b)

enforceable under the Statute of Frauds. (Art. 1356)

A donated land to B in a private instrument. B accepted
in the same private instrument. B then wanted to have
the donation registered but registration requires a public
instrument. So B requested A to put down the donation in
a public instrument. But A refused. B then sued to compel
A to observe the necessary form. Decide.

ANS.: A cannot be compelled under Art. 1357 because
the donation is not valid.
(b) Same as problem (a) except that the land has already been
actually delivered to B. May A be compelled to execute the
needed public instrument?
AJVS.; Again the answer is NO, for the simple reason
that the donation is null and void.
(c) A sold to B in a private instrument his land. Later B wanted
to have the sale registered, but registration requires a
public instrument. May B compel A to execute the needed
public instrument?
ANS.: Yes, because the contract is both valid and
enforceable under the Statute of Frauds.
(d) Same as (c) except that the sale was made orally. May B
compel A to execute the needed public instrument?

(3) Cases

Jomoc v. Court of Appeals
GR 92871, Aug. 2, 1991

FACTS: The subject lot forms part of the estate of the late
Pantaleon Jomoc. Because it was fictitiously sold and transferred
to third persons, Maria Vda. Jomoc, as administratrix of the
estate and in behalf of all the heirs, filed suit to recover the
property before the trial court (Civil Case 4750). Mariano
So, the last of the transferees and the husband of Maura So,
intervened. The case was decided in favor of Jomoc and was
accordingly appealed by Mariano So and one Gaw Sur Cheng to
the Court of Appeals. In Feb. 1979, pending the appeal, Jomoc
executed a Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement and Sale of Land
with Maura So for P300.000. The document was not yet signed
by all the parties nor notarized but, in the meantime, Maura
So had made partial payments amounting to P49.000. In 1983,
Mariano So, the appellant in the recovery proceeding, agreed to
settle the case by executing a deed of reconveyance of the land in
favor of the heirs of Pantaleon Jomoc. The reconveyance was in
compliance with the decision in the recovery case and resulted in
the dismissal of his appeal. On Feb. 28, 1983, the heirs of Jomoc
executed another extrajudicial settlement with absolute sale in
favor of intervenors Kang and King. Maura So demanded from
the Jomoc family the execution of a final deed of conveyance.
They ignored the demand. Thus, Maura So sued Jomoc heirs for
specific performance to compel them to execute and deliver the
proper registrable deed of sale over the lot (Civil Case No. 8983).
She then filed a notice of lis pendens with the Register of Deeds
on Feb. 28, 1983. On the same date, allegedly upon Jomoc’s
belief that Maura So had backed out from the transaction, the
Jomocs executed the other extrajudicial settlement with sale of
registered land in favor of the spouses Lim for P200.000 part of
which amount was allegedly intended to be returned to Maura
So as reimbursement. The spouses Lim, however, registered
their settlement and sale only on April 27, 1983. The Jomocs
as defendants, and the spouses Lim as intervenors, alleged
703

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1357

that complainant Maura So backed out as evidenced by an oral
testimony that she did so in a conference with Jomoc’s lawyers
where she expressed frustration in evicting squatters who
demanded large sums as a condition for vacating. They alleged
the lack of signatures of four of the heirs of Jomoc and Maura
So herself as well as the lack of notarization. The lower court,
finding that there was no sufficient evidence to show Mariano
So’s withdrawal from the sale, concluded that: (1) the case is one
of double sale; (2) the spouses-intervenors Mariano and Maura
So are registrants in bad faith who registered their deed of sale
long after the notice of lis pendens of Civil Case No. 8983 was
recorded. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the trial court’s
decision, except for the award of moral and exemplary damages,
attorney’s fees and expenses for litigation.

HELD: The Supreme Court affirmed the CA’s decision
and held that Lim spouses’ allegation that the contract of
sale by Maria Jomoc with Maura So is enforceable under the
Statute of Frauds, is without merit. Lim spouses do not deny
the existence of Exhibit A, including its terms and contents,
notwithstanding the incompleteness in form. The meeting of the
minds and the delivery of sums as partial payment is admitted
by both parties to the agreement. Hence, there was already a
valid and existing contract, not merely perfected as the trial
court saw it, but partly executed. It is of no moment whether
or not it is enforceable under the Statute of Frauds, which rule
is not applicable because of partial payment of the vendee’s
obligation and its acceptance by the vendors-heirs. The contract
of sale of real property even if not complete in form, so long as
the essential requisites of consent of the contracting parties,
object and cause of the obligation concur and they were clearly
established to be present, is valid and effective as between the
parties. Under Art. 1357 of the Civil Code, its enforceability
is recognized as each contracting party is granted the right to
compel the other to execute the proper public instrument so that
the valid contract of sale of registered land can be duly registered
and can bind third persons. Maura So correctly exercised such
right simultaneously with a prayer for the enforcement of the
contract in one complaint. She did not abandon her intention of
purchasing the subject lot. The contracting parties to Exhibit A
agreed that “the consideration of P300,000 or whatever balance
704

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1358

remains after deducting the advanced payments thereon, shall
be paid upon the termination of (Mariano So’s) appeal in the
case involving the property in question.” Even if the sums paid
by Maura So were intended to expedite the dismissal of Mariano
So’s appeal, such payment only indicate interest in acquiring the
lot. In addition, the claim by the Lim spouses that the payments
were for the gathering of the several heirs from far places to sign
Exhibit A confirms Maura So’s continuing interest. The terms of
Exhibit A and the actual intention of the parties are clear and no
reform requiring parol evidence is being sought to elucidate the
intention further. The oral evidence offered by the Lim spouses
to show a subsequent refusal to proceed with the sale cannot be
considered to reverse the express intention in the contract.

Lim v. Court of Appeals
68 SCAD 679
(1996)

A contract of agency to sell on commission basis does not
belong to any of the three categories mentioned in Arts. 1357 and
1358 of the Civil Code and Art. 1403 of the Statute of Frauds;
hence, it is valid and enforceable in whatever form it may be
entered into.

Art. 1358. The following must appear in a public document:
(1) Acts and contracts which have for their object the
creation, transmission, modification or extinguishment of real
rights over immovable property; sales of real property or of
an interest therein are governed by Articles 1403, No. 2, and
1405;
(2) The cession, repudiation or renunciation of
hereditary rights or of those of the conjugal partnership of

gains;
(3) The power to administer property, or any other
power which has for its object an act appearing or which
should appear in a public document, or should prejudice a
third person;

(4) The cession of actions or rights proceeding from an
act appearing in a public document.

705

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1358

All other contracts where the amount involved exceeds
five hundred pesos must appear in writing, even a private one.
But sales of goods, chattels or things in action are governed
by Articles 1403, No. 2 and 1405.

COMMENT:
(1) Form for Convenience
The necessity for the public document in the contracts
enumerated here is only for convenience, not for validity or
enforceability. (Thunga Chui v. Que Bentec, 2 Phil. 561; Del
Castillo v. Escarella, 26 Phil. 406; and Guerrero v. Miguel, 10

must be in writing. If not, Art. 1357 cannot be availed of. If not

[NOTE: In the case of Segunda Pomellosa, et al. v. The
Land Tenure Administration, et al., L-14040, Jan. 31, 1961,
the Supreme Court surprisingly held, contrary to previous
cases, that while a sale in a PRIVATE document of a lot and
the house constructed thereon is valid upon the parties with
respect to the sale of the house erected thereon, yet it is not
sufficient to convey title or any right to the residential lot in
litigation. Citing Art. 1358(1) of the Civil Code, the Court held
that acts and contracts which have for their object the creation,
transmission, modification or extinguishment of real rights over
immovable property must appear in a public document. It should
be observed however that in this case, the ruling adverted to
may be considered a mere OBITER, since under the facts of the
case the seller was NOT the owner of the property involved.]

parties.

Formal requirements are for the benefit of third parties.
Non-compliance therewith does not adversely affect the validity
of the contract nor the contractual rights and obligations of the
parties thereunder.
(2) Problem

A loan was contracted orally. If the amount is P800, may
the lender recover the sum lent?

ANS.: Yes, because although the law says that contracts
involving more than P500 must appear in writing, even a
private one, still this requirement is only for convenience, not
for validity. (Thunga Chui v. Que Bentec, 2 Phil. 561 provides
the correct rule and not Que Yong Keng v. Tan Quico, 14 Phil.
173, which provides the wrong rule.)

himself of Art. 1357, the right to compel the execution of the

The principle that to destroy the validity of an existing
public document, strong and convincing evidence is necessary,
operates only when the action is brought by one party against the
other to impugn the contract, and not when the suit is instituted
by a third person, not a party to the contract, but precisely the
victim of it.

Castillo v. Castillo
L-18238, Jan. 22, 1980

A recital in a public instrument celebrated with all the
legal formalities under the safeguard of a notarial certificate
is evidence against the parties and a high degree of proof is
necessary to overcome the legal presumption that such recital
is true. (See Valencia v. Tantoco, et al., 99 Phil. 824)

REFORMATION OF INSTRUMENTS (n)
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
(1) ‘Reformation of Instrument’ Defined

As a remedy in equity, reformation of an instrument is
where a written instrument already executed is allowed by law
to be reformed or construed to express or conform to the real
intention of the parties. (Rosario v. Alvar, 839 SCRA 138(2017])
(2) Reason for Reformation

“Equity orders the reformation of an instrument in
order that the true intention of the contracting parties may be
expressed. The courts do not attempt to make another contract
for the parties. The rationale of the doctrine is that it would be
uryust and inequitable to allow the enforcement of a written
instrument which does not reflect or disclose the real meeting
of the minds of the parties. The rigor of the legalistic rule that
a written instrument should be the final and inflexible criterion
and measure of the rights and obligations of the contracting
parties is thus tempered to forestall the effects of mistake,
fraud, inequitable conduct or accident.” (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 56)

Art. 1359. When, there having been a meeting of the

minds of the parties to a contract, their true intention is
not expressed in the instrument purporting to embody the
agreement, by reason of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct
or accident, one of the parties may ask for the reformation
of the instrument to the end that such true intention may be
expressed.

708

709

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1359

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct, or accident has
prevented a meeting of the minds of the parties, the proper
remedy is not reformation of the instrument but annulment
of the contract.

.

J

I

COMMENT:
(1) Distinctions between ‘Reformation’ and ‘Annulment*
(a)

Where there has been a meeting of the minds, but there
is mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct or accident in the
contract as written, the remedy is REFORMATION. When
there has been no meeting of the minds, because of vitiated
consent, the proper remedy is ANNULMENT.

Example:

If the seller was selling for Pl,000,000 but the buyer
thought he was buying for P500.000 and the contract states
Pl,000,000, there has been no meeting of the minds and
the remedy is annulment; but if both agreed on P500,000
and the contract as written states Pl,000,000, the remedy
is reformation, because here, there has been a meeting of
the minds.
(b)

Reformation does not invalidate a contract; annulment
invalidates a contract.

(2) Requisites for the Action for Reformation
(a)

There must be a meeting of the minds.

(b)

The true intention is not expressed in the instrument.
Sarming v. Dy
GR 133643, June 6, 2002

All of the requisites regarding an action for
reformation of instrument provided under Art. 1359 of the
Civil Code, are present in the instant case. Thus:

There was a meeting of the minds between the parties
to the contract but the deed did not express the true
intention of the parties due to mistake in the designation
of the lot subject of the deed. There is no dispute as to the
710

Art. 1359

intention of the parties to sell the land to Alejandra Delfino
but there was a mistake as to the designation of the lot
intended to be sold as stated in the Settlement of Estate
and Sale.
(c)

There must be clear and convincing proof thereof.

[NOTE: Mere preponderance of evidence here would not be
sufficient. (Gonzales Mondragon v. Santos, 48 O.G. 560)]
(d) It must be brought within the proper prescriptive period.
(e) The document must not refer to a simple unconditional
donation inter vivos (Art. 1366), or to wills (Art. 1366), or
to a contract where the real agreement is void. (Art. 1366)

BA Finance Corp. v. IAC & Rene Tan
GR 76497, Jan. 20, 1993

In the case at bar, there is no dispute that there was
a meeting of the minds with respect to the arrangement
whereby the private respondent borrows money from the
petitioner and the subject car serves as security for the
payment of the loaned amount. The private respondent had
insisted that what he merely intended in contracting with
the petitioner was to secure a loan with his Volkswagen
Sedan as collateral. Upon the other hand, the petitioner,
by virtue of the private respondent’s loan application,
prepared the necessary papers which included a Deed
of Absolute Sale of the subject car in its favor in order
that its legal ownership shall serve as the security for
the repayment of the amount being loaned by the private
respondent through the payment of monthly rentals under
a Contract of Lease which the latter duly signed.
In order that an action for reformation may prosper,
there must be a meeting of the minds of the parties
to a contract, but their true intention is not expressed
therein by reason of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct
or accident. Notwithstanding, the private respondent has
not succeeded in proving the above circumstances to avail
of the remedy of reformation. In attempting to prove his
allegation that a contract of simple loan was intended, the
private respondent pointed out the discrepancy between
711

Art. 1359

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the purchase price of P20.000 as indicated in the Deed
of Absolute Sale and the amount of P15,913.06 actually
received by him as evidenced by a check dated Oct. 22,
1976 issued to Martina Industries by the petitioner with
regard to the financing arrangement agreed upon by them.
Such discrepancy dismisses the petitioner’s position that
he had agreed to sell his car to the petitioner; hence, the
basis for the financing lease contract as claimed by the
petitioner is not existent. For all intents and purposes, a
“financing lease” may be seen to be a contract sui generis,
possessing some but not necessarily all of the elements
of an ordinary or civil law lease. Thus, legal title to the
equipment leased is lodged in the financial lessor. The
financial lessee is entitled to the possession and use of the
leased equipment. At the same time, the financial lessee
is obligated to make periodic payments denominated as
lease rentals, which enable the financial lessor to recover
the purchase price of the equipment which had been paid
to the supplier thereof.
(3) No New Contract Is Made

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arte. 1360-1361

ISSUE: Can the action for reformation still prosper despite
the existence of the mortgage in favor of a third person?
HELD: Yes, the action for reformation may still prosper
despite the mortgage in favor of the third person. If the plaintiffs
should succeed in having the contract reformed, and thus get
back their property (by paying the mortgage debt), the property
would be theirs, subject only to the mortgage rights of the third
person, or it may even be possible that the defendant would be
ordered by the Court to free the property from the mortgage be¬
fore giving the property to the plaintiffs. The motion to dismiss
should be denied.
Art. 1360. The principles of the general law on the

reformation of instruments are hereby adopted insofar as
they are not in conflict with the provisions of this Code.

COMMENT:
Rule in Case of Conflict
In case of conflict between the Civil Code and the principles
of the general law on reformation, the former prevails. The latter
will have only suppletory effect.

Cosio v. Palileo
L-18452, May 31, 1965
In reforming instruments, courts do not make another
contract for the parties. They merely inquire into the intention
of the parties and having found it, reform the written instrument
(not the content), in order that it may express the real intention
of the parties.

Art. 1361. When a mutual mistake of the parties causes
the failure of the instrument to disclose their real agreement,
said instrument may be reformed.

(4) Reformation May Still Prosper Even If Property Involved

(1) When Reformation May Be Asked Because of Mutual

Is Already Mortgaged by Buyer to a Third Person
Jayme, et al. v. Alampay, et al.
L-39592, Jan. 28, 1975

FACTS: A married couple entered into a contract of
mortgage, but the instrument signed was one of absolute sale,
so an action for reformation was brought. A motion to dismiss
was filed on the ground that the property involved was already
actually mortgaged by the ostensible buyer to a third person.
712

COMMENT:
Mistake
Under this Article, the mistake must be mutual.
(b) The mistake may be unilateral under the conditions set
forth in Arts. 1362 and 1363 of the Civil Code.
(a)

(c)

The mistake must be of fact - usually. Therefore, generally
an error of law is not enough. (Bank of the P .1. v. Fidelity
& Surety Co. of the P.I., 51 Phil. 57)
713

Art. 1361

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(2) Example

A sold to B orally a house at 16 San Isidro, Malate. In the
written public document, both forgot the true number of the
house and instead wrote on the contract “No. 18 San Isidro,
Malate.” Here, reformation of the instrument is proper.
(3) Another Example

A made a check in favor of B. C wrote in the note “I
guarantee that A will not suffer any harm.” B now seeks to
reform the instrument saying that the note should state “I
guarantee that B will not suffer any harm” and that the mistake
was mutual. ButB was not able to satisfactorily prove that there
was such a mistake. Should the instrument be reformed?

ANS.: No, the instrument should not be reformed. The
plaintiff Bank (B) has not established a mutual mistake by proof
of the clearest and most satisfactory character constituting more
than a preponderance of evidence. To justify the reformation of a
written instrument upon the ground of mistake, die concurrence
of three things are necessary:

First, that the mistake should be of a fact;

Second, that the mistake should be proved by clear and

convincing evidence; and

Third, that the mistake should be common to both parties
to the instrument (where mutual mistake is alleged). (Bank of
the Philippine Islands v. Fidelity and Surety Company of the
P.I., 51 Phil. 57)

(4) Case

San Miguel Brewery v.
La Union and Rock Insurance Co.
40 Phil. 674
FACTS: In the preparatory negotiations for a contract of
insurance, it was agreed that the interest of both the owner and
the mortgagee of the property should be protected. However, as
written, because of mistake, only the interests of the mortgagee
were protected.
714

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1362

ISSUE: Does the court have the right to reform the
contract?
HELD: Yes, because of the mutual error.
Art. 1362. If one party was mistaken and the other acted
fraudulently or inequitably in such a way that the instrument
does not show their true intention, the former may ask for
the reformation of the instrument.

COMMENT:
(1) Unilateral Mistake

In this Article, the mistake is unilateral but the other party
acted fraudulently or inequitably.
(2) Example

A agreed with B that A would be loaned PIO,000,000 by
B. In the contract signed by A and B, it was stated that A was
selling his house to B for said amount. A signed the contract
in the belief that it was really a contract of loan. Who, if any,
may ask for the reformation of the instrument if B had acted
fraudulently?

ANS.: A may ask for the reformation of the instrument
because after the meeting of the minds, one party (B) acted
fraudulently or inequitably in such a way that the contract
does not show their real intention. In such a case, the law
provides that the person who acted by mistake may ask for the
reformation of the instrument.
(3) Case

Ong Chua v. Carr, et al.
53 Phil. 975

FACTS: Teck sold his land to Ong with the right to
repurchase within four years. Ong sold the land to Carr with the
understanding that Carr was buying it, subject to the right to
repurchase on the part of Teck. At that time, Carr did not have
enough money. So Carr asked for a loan from an Association. The
715

Arts. 1363-1364

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Association offered to give a loan provided Carr could offer, as
security, land of which he was the absolute owner, that is, land
which would not be subject for example to repurchase. So Carr
began to think. With the help of a lawyer who drafted the deed,
Carr and Ong (who did not know English) signed a contract in
which Carr was made out to be the absolute owner of the land,
and the words regarding the “right to repurchase” omitted.
Later Teck was repurchasing the property from Ong, and Ong
demanded the reconveyance of the property from Carr. Canrefused on the ground that he (Carr) was the absolute owner of
the land. Hence, Ong brought this action against Carr.
ISSUE: May the contract be reformed? If so, may Ong now
demand the land from Carr so that it would be resold to Teck?
HELD: Yes, the contract may be reformed because “if
one party was mistaken and the other acted fraudulently or
inequitably in such a way that the instrument does not show
their true intention, the former may ask for the reformation of
the instrument.” (Art. 1362, Civil Code) It follows, therefore,
that Ong may now demand the reconveyance of the property to
him so that the land may be repurchased by Teck.

Art. 1363. When one party was mistaken and the other
knew or believed that the instrument did not state their
real agreement, but concealed that fact from the former, the
instrument may be reformed.

COMMENT:
Unilateral Mistake Also
(a)

Here again, the mistake is unilateral but the other party
is guilty of concealment.

(b)

Only the party in good faith can ask for reformation.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1866

COMMENT:
(1) Failure to Convey the True Intent

The court may order the reformation of the instrument if
the instrument does not convey the true intention of the parties
because of the:
(a)
(b)
(c)

ignorance

lack of skill
bad faith of
1)
2)

3)

the drafter of the instrument
or the clerk
or the typist.

(2) Case

Manila Engineering Co. v. Cranston and Heacock
45 Phil. 128
FACTS: In a contract, although the original draft read in
dollars, the contract was made out in pesos through the typist’s
fault.
ISSUE: May the instrument be reformed?
HELD: Yes. “It conclusively appears from the collateral
facts and surrounding circumstances that it was intended that
the dollar sign was to be used and that defendant knew or in the
ordinary course of business should have known that a mistake
was made. The contract will be reformed and the dollar sign
substituted for the peso sign.”
Art. 1365. If two parties agree upon the mortgage or
pledge of real or personal property, but the instrument
states that the property is sold absolutely or with a right of
repurchase, reformation of the instrument is proper.

Art. 1364. When through the ignorance, lack of skill,
negligence or bad faith on the part of the person drafting the
instrument or of the clerk or typist, the instrument does not
express the true intention of the parties, the
courts may order
that the instrument be reformed.

COMMENT:
(1) Intent to Have a Mortgage or Pledge
Example:
B wanted to borrow from L, so he offered by way of
mortgage his land as security. Both parties agreed on this point

716

717

Art. 1366

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

but the contract as drafted contained an absolute sale. May the
instrument be reformed?

ANS.: Yes, otherwise, the true intention of the parties
would be frustrated.
(2) How to Judge the Parties’ Intent

The intention of the parties can be judged from their
contemporaneous and subsequent acts. (Velasquez u. Teodoro,
46 Phil. 757)
Art. 1366. There shall be no reformation in the following
cases:
(1)

Simple donations inter vivos wherein no condition

is imposed;
(2)

Will;

(3)

When the real agreement is void.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(4) Reason for Instance No. 3 (Void Agreement)

Reformation is not allowed in case the real agreement
is void because such a procedure would be useless. Once
reformation is made, the new instrument would be void precisely
because the true agreement and intention are void.
Art. 1367. When one of the parties has brought an action
to enforce the instrument he cannot subsequently ask for its

reformation.
COMMENT:

(1) Effect of an Action to Enforce the Instrument
(a)

This Article presents another instance when reformation
cannot prosper.

(b)

Basis is estoppel, waiver or ratification.

*

COMMENT:

Arts. 1367-1368

(2) Example

(1) When Reformation Is Not Allowed

The Article gives three instances when reformation is not
allowed.
(2) Reason for Instance No. 1 (Simple Donations)

Donations are essentially acts of pure liberality. However,
if the donation is conditional, reformation may be resorted to so
that the real or true conditions intended by the donor might be
brought out. In case the donation is an onerous one, reformation
is very much in order inasmuch as in this case, said donation
would partake very much of the nature of contracts.
(3) Reason for Instance No. 2 (Wills)

The making of a will is strictly a personal act (Art. 784,
Civil Code) which is free. (Art. 839, Civil Code) Moreover, a will
may be revoked at any time. (Art. 828, Civil Code)
[NOTE: However, after the death of the testator, errors or
imperfections in descriptions may be corrected under Art. 789 of
the Civil Code, but not the manner of property disposal.]
718

A sold B a house. A fraudulently made the contract one of
mortgage instead of sale. Both signed the contract of mortgage,
with B believing all the time that it was a contract of sale. B,
therefore, has the right to bring an action for the reformation
of the instrument; but if B brings an action to foreclose the
mortgage, he is by said action enforcing the instrument. He
cannot, therefore, subsequently ask for the reformation of the
instrument to make it one of sale.

Art. 1368. Reformation may be ordered at the instance of
either party or his successors in interest, if the mistake was
mutual; otherwise, upon petition of the injured party, or his
heirs and assigns.

(a)

If the mistake is mutual, either party or his successors in
interest;

(b)

In all other cases:
1) the injured party,
2) his heirs and assigns.

(2) Problem

A and B agreed on a certain contract, but A fraudulently
made a document reciting another kind of contract. Later, both
A and B died.
(a) May the son ofB bring an action to reform the instrument?
(b)

May the son of A bring an action to reform the instrument?

ANS.:
1)

Yes, the son of B may bring an action to reform the
instrument because he is the heir of the injured party.

2)

No, the son of A cannot bring a successful action to
reform the instrument inasmuch as it was the father
who caused the fraud.
Query: But suppose the son ofA wanted tocorrect
the fraud made by his father?

ANS.: This is all right but in such a case, no
court action is needed anymore, since both parties
can agree to reform the instrument by themselves.

2)

Moreover, courts do not reform instruments merely
for the sake of reforming them, but only to enable
some party to assert rights under them as reformed.
(23 RCL, par. 2)]

(4) Prescriptive Period for Reformation of a Contract

Antonio Jayme, et al. v. Hon. Nestor Alampay
L-39592, Jan. 28, 1975

The period of prescription for the reformation of a contract
(such as one ostensibly an absolute sale but actually a mortgage)
is ten years.
Art. 1369. The procedure for the reformation of
instruments shall be governed by Rules of Court to be
promulgated by the Supreme Court.

COMMENT:
Procedural Rules
These procedural rules are supposed to be promulgated by
the Supreme Court.

(3) What Complaint Must Allege

Before reformation can be granted, the complaint must

allege:
that the instrument to be reformed does not express the
real agreement or intention of the parties ( Ongsiako, et al.
v. Ongsiako, et al., L-7510, March 30, 1957);
(b) what the real agreement or intention was. (Garcia v.

INTERPRETATION OF CONTRACTS
Art. 1370. If the terms of a contract are clear and leave
no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the
literal meaning of its stipulations shall control.
If the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention
of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.

COMMENT:
(1) Reason for Interpretation of Contracts

What is the use of interpreting a contract? Should we not
just apply the terms of the contract? It is true we must apply
the terms of the contract, but only when they are so clear that
there is no doubt regarding the intention of the contracting
parties. But in other cases, we should apply the rules of interpre¬

tation.
(2) Rule in Case of Conflict

In case of conflict between the words of the contract and
the evident intention of the parties, which one must prevail?
ANS.: The intention must prevail. “Let us interpret not
by the letter that killeth but by the spirit that giveth life.” “If
the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention of the
parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.” (2nd par., Art.
1370, Civil Code)
Where the terms and provisions thereof are clear and
leave no doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties, the
literal meaning of its stipulation shall control. (R & M General

10 Phil. 53

FACTS: A document reads as follows: “Received from Dona
Maria Aniversario the sum of P510, in payment of the price of
a white horse purchased at San Juan de Bocoboc, Manila, Nov.
25, 1902. (SGD). FLORENTINO TERNATE.”
ISSUE: Was the money paid for a horse already purchased
or for a horse still to be purchased?
HELD: The money was paid for a horse already purchased.
The document “exhibited by the plaintiff in support of her
action does not prove the allegation of the complaint but those
of the answer of the defendant, to the effect that the latter,
on the abovementioned date, received the sum of P510, not to
purchase a horse at that time, as contended by the plaintiff,
but in payment of the price of a white horse already bought, as
alleged by the defendant. This construction by the lower court
is in conformity with the provisions of Art. 1281 of the Civil
Code (now Art. 1370 of the new Civil Code) which says that
“if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to
the intention of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its
provisions shall be observed.”

FACTS: In a written contract, the parties agreed that “all
legal actions arising out of this contract. . . may be brought in
and submitted to the jurisdiction ofthe proper courts in the City

in the Court where the defendant or the plaintiff resides at the
election of the plaintiff?
723

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1370

—

HELD: Yes, the parties may sue elsewhere the clause
in question being permissive only in view of the use of the word
“may.” Venue (or the place of trial) in personal actions is fixed
for the convenience of the parties and to promote the ends of
justice. To confine the venue here to Manila would not serve the
interests of justice. In a similar case previously decided, re the
stipulation that the parties consent to sue or be sued in Manila,
the Court held that such stipulation did not make Manila the
obligatory venue. The stipulation only ADDS Manila to the

[NOTE: It would have been different if the parties had
categorically stated in the contract that Manila would be the
ONLY venue.)

[NOTE: “Sellers desirous of making conditional
sales of
their goods, but who do not wish openly to make a bargain in
that form, for one reason or another, have frequently resorted to
the device of making contracts in the form of leases either with
options to the buyer to purchase for a small consideration
at the
end of the term, provided the so-called rent has been duly paid,
or with stipulations that if the rent through the term is paid,
title shall thereupon vest in the lessee. It is obvious that such
transactions are leases only in name. The so-called rent must
necessarily be regarded as payment of the price in installments,
since due payment of the agreed amount results, by the terms
of the bargain, in the transfer of title to the lessee.” (Vda.

Pay v. Vda. de Palanca

63 Phil. 582

FACTS: A promissory note stated that it was payable upon
receipt of the debtor of cash payment from a certain estate, or

FACTS: A needed money badly. So he asked B for a loan,
offering his (A’s) house as security. B did not want to lend with
a mortgage as security, but he offered to buy the house, with
the right of repurchase on the part of A. The money paid was a
small sum, considering the value of the house. When the period
for repurchase ended, and A had not yet redeemed the property,
the title of absolute ownership was vested in B, the vendee a retro
(the buyer in a sale with the right of repurchase). B thereupon
asked A to leave the house. A refused. Hence, B brought this
action to oust A.

upon demand.

ISSUE: Is this obligation demandable at once?
HELD: Yes, because of the clear import of the words “or
upon demand.”

Abella v. Gonzaga
56 Phil. 132

FACTS: A and B entered into a so-called contract of lease,
whereby B would pay certain regular amounts as “rentals” and
at the end of the “lease,” B would become the absolute owner of
the property.

ISSUE: Is this really a lease or a sale in installments!
HELD: This contract is really a sale in installments for
such was the evident intention of the contracting parties.
“Although in the contract, Exhibit A, the usual words
lease,’ ‘lessee,’ and “lessor’ were employed, that is not obstacle
to holding, as the court hereby holds, that said contract was a
sale on installments, for such was the evident intention of the
parties in entering into said contract.”
724

ISSUE: Is the contract really a sale with the right of
repurchase(pacto de retro) or is it really a mortgage (an equitable

mortgage)?

Importance of the issue: If it is really a pacto de retro
contract, B is now the owner of the property because the house
was not redeemed by A during the period for repurchase, and
therefore A should be ousted. On the other hand, if the contract
should be interpreted as an equitable mortgage, ownership has
not yet been vested on B because foreclosure proceedings should
still be done, and therefore A should still remain in the house.
HELD: Although apparently this is a pacto de retro, it really
is an equitable mortgage, for considering the circumstances of
the case, the purpose of the contract was really to make the

to sell the house.

Jimenez v. Bucoy
L-10221, Feb. 28, 1958
FACTS: A promissory note stated: “Received from Miss
Pacifica Jimenez the total amount of PIO,000 payable six months
after the war, without interest.” It was alleged that the note
contained no express promise to pay.

ISSUE: Was there a promise here?
HELD: Yes. Implicitly, there was a promise to pay the
amount stated. An acknowledgment may become a promise by
the addition of words by which a promise of payment is naturally
implied, such as “payable.”
Bijis v. Legaspi
L-10705, March 30, 1960

FACTS: In a deed of sale, a certain lot No. 1357 was
mentioned as the parcel sold, but both parties meant Lot No.
1155, and in fact buyer took possession of the latter with the
knowledge of the seller.
HELD: Since the parties really meant Lot No. 1155, this
should be considered the object of the contract.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1370

ISSUE: How should the contract be regarded?
HELD: The contract should be regarded as a “leasehold
tenancy relation” because it is not the name given by the parties
that controls but their real intent as gleaned from the purposes

of the contract.

As distinguished from an ordinary lease contract, the
following are the principal elements of a “leasehold tenancy
contract or relation”:
(a)

The object is agricultural land leased for agricultural
production;

(b)

The size of the landholding must be such that it is
susceptible of personal cultivation by a single person, with
the assistance from the members of his immediate farm
household;

(c)

The tenant-lessee must actually and personally till,
cultivate or operate said land, solely or with the aid of labor
from his immediate farm household; and

(d)

The landlord-lessor, who is either the lawful owner or the
legal possessor of the land, leases the same to the tenant¬
lessee for a price certain or ascertainable in an amount
either of money or produce.

Leonor v. Sycip
L-14220, April 29, 1961

FACTS: A guarantor guaranteed the payment of rentals
already due at the time the promise was made.

If no beneficiary is named for the retirement benefits of
a government employee, it is understood that the benefits will
accrue to his estate.

ISSUE: Is he also responsible for subsequent rents?
HELD: Under the facts, it is clear he never had the
obligations to pay the subsequent rents.
Fidel Teodoro v. Felix Macaraeg
and Court of Agrarian Relations

People v. Hon. Constante A. Ancheta, et al.
L-39993, May 19, 1975

FACTS: One of the reasons given to disqualify Judge
Constante A. Ancheta of the Criminal Circuit Court of Bulacan
from hearing a particular case was the fact that he asked
searching and minute questions of the witnesses in order to
properly interpret their testimonies and clear up ambiguities.
727

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1370

ISSUE: Is this a proper ground to disqualify said judge?
HELD: No, this would not be a proper ground for
disqualification; otherwise, the discretion of a trial judge would
be curtailed if minute and searching queries from the bench
would be invested with a sinister significance. Litigants should
remember that a judge is there precisely to ascertain the truth
of the controversy before him. He enjoys a great deal of latitude
therefore in examining witnesses within the limits of course
of evidentiary rules. It is fitting and proper that a testimony
should not be incomplete or obscure. After all, the judge is the
arbiter, and he must be in a position to satisfy himself as to the
respective merits of the claims of both parties. This is not to
deny, of course, that there may be cases where an analysis of
the questions asked will reveal bias.

GSIS v. Court of Appeals
GR 52478, Oct. 30, 1986
FACTS: The mortgage contract provides that the rate
of interest be 9% per annum compounded monthly, and any
installment or amortization that remains due and unpaid shall
bear interest at the rate of 9 1/2% per month. Later, because the
loan was increased, an “Amendment of Real Estate Mortgage”
was executed. The mortgagor claims that since the amendment
contained no stipulation on compounded interest, since the
amendment superseded the original contract, he should not be
required to pay compounded interest on the arrearages.
HELD: There is no ambiguity in the terms and conditions
of the amendment of the mortgage contract. The prior,
contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties show
that said amendment was never intended to completely
supersede the original mortgage contract. First, the amendment
recognizes the existence and effectivity of the previous contract.
Second, nowhere in the amendment did the parties manifest
their intention to supersede the original contract. Third, the
amendment confirms and ratifies and considers in full force
and effect the terms and conditions of the original mortgage
and are made an integral part of the amendment. As a matter
of policy, the GSIS imposes uniform terms and conditions for all
its real estate loans, particularly with respect to compounding
of interest.

U.P. College of Agriculture v. Gabriel
GR 70826, Oct. 12, 1987

FACTS: The sub-contract between the contractor and
the sub-contractor states: “The terms of payment shall be on a
monthly basis as per form accomplished and approved by the
University of the Philippines College of Agriculture.”
HELD: This stipulation is clear and leaves no doubt as to
the intention of the contracting parties. It is essential that the
works completed by the sub-contractor be approved before U.P.
can be made liable under the sub-contract. It is of no moment
that the sub-contractor wrote U.P. that the contractor had not
yet paid all its obligations to the former. This does not necessarily
mean approval of the sub-contractor’s work.

Azcona V. Jamanrirp
GR 30597, June 30, 1987

FACTS: The agreed yearly rental for an 80-hectare land
was P7,200 for the three agricultural years beginning 1960,
extendible at the lessee’s option to more agricultural years up
to 1965. The first annual rental was due on or before March
30, 1960. The lessee actually entered the premises only on
Oct. 26, 1960 after payment of the sum of P7,000, which was
acknowledged in a receipt which states: “The amount of SEVEN
THOUSAND PESOS (P7.000),
as payment for the rental
corresponding to crop year 1961-62” ... to rental due on or before
January 30, 1961, “as per contract.” The lessor claims that the
lessee defaulted in payment because the latter was P200 short
of such rental, and concludes that the contract should be deemed
cancelled. The trial court held that the P200 has been condoned.
HELD: The words “as per contract” found in the receipt of
payment suggest that the parties were aware of the provisions
of the agreement, which was described in detail elsewhere in
the receipt. The rental stipulated in the contract was P7.200.
The payment acknowledged in the receipt was P7.000 only. Yet
no mention was made in the receipt of the discrepancy. On the
contrary, the payment was acknowledged “as per contract.” This
means that the provisions of the contract were being maintained
and respected except only for the reduction of the agreed rental.

...

729

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1370

The P200 was not condoned as held by the trial court.
The requisites of condonation under Art. 1270 of the Civil Code
are not present. What we see here is a mere reduction of the
stipulated rental in consideration of the withdrawal of the leased
premises of the 16 hectares where the lessor intended to graze his
cattle. When the lessor accepted the receipt, he manifested his
agreement on the reduction, which modified the lease contract as
to the agreed consideration while leaving the other stipulations
intact. That the amount of P7,000 was “payment in full” of the
rental was adequately conveyed in the acknowledgment made
by lessor that this was “payment for the rental corresponding
to crop year 1961-62" and “corresponds to the rentals due on or
before Jan. 30, 1961, as per contract.” The relative insignificance
of the alleged balance is a paltry justification for annulling the
contract for its supposed violation. If lessor is fussy enough to
invoke it now, he would have fussed over it too in the receipt
he willingly signed after accepting, without reservation, only
P7.000. When the obligee accepts the performance, knowing
its incompleteness or irregularity, and without expressing any
protest or objection, the obligation is deemed fully complied with.

Simeon Del Rosario v. Shell Co.
of the Phils., Ltd.
L-28776, Aug. 19, 1988
If provided for in a contract, should business rentals
be adjusted in relation to the peso value vis a-vis the U.S.
dollar under “devaluation” or “appreciation” (opposite of
“depreciation”)?

Yes. Any resultant decrease (or increase) in the par value
of the currency is precisely the situation or event contemplated
by the parties in their contract; accordingly, an upward (or
downward) revision of the rent is called for.
[NOTA BENE: It is interesting to note in the abovecited
case that the contract at bar used the alternative term
“appreciation.” Any dictionary defines appreciation as a rise
in value. Now if according to said contract there shall be an
adjustment of the monthly rental in the event of a rise in the
value of the Philippine currency, why should there be no similar
adjustment in the event of a decrease in value of the same

currency?]

The Manila Banking Corp. v. Anastacio
Teodoro, Jr. and Grace Anna Teodoro
GR S3955, Jan. 13, 1989
The character of the transaction between the parties is to
be determined by their intention, regardless of what language
was used or what the form of transfer was. If it was intended to
secure the payment of money, it must be construed as a pledge.
However, even though a transfer, if regarded by itself, appears
to have been absolute, its object and character might still be
qualified and explained by a contemporaneous writing declaring
it to have been a deposit of the property as collateral security.
It has been said that a transfer of property by the
debtor to a creditor, even if sufficient on its face to make an
absolute conveyance, should be treated as a pledge if the debt
continues in existence and is not discharged by the transfer,
and that accordingly, the use of the terms ordinarily importing
conveyance of absolute ownership will not be given that effect
in such a transaction if they are also commonly used in pledges
and mortgages and, therefore, do not unqualifiedly indicate
a transfer of absolute ownership, in the absence of clear and
ambiguous language or other circumstances excluding an intent
to pledge.

Definitely, the assignment of the receivables did not
result from a sales transaction. It cannot be said to have been
constituted by virtue of a dation in payment for appellant’s
loans with the bank evidenced by promissory notes which are
the subject of the suit for collection. At the time the deed of
assignment was executed, said loans were non-existent yet. At
most, it was a dation in payment for P10,000, the amount of
credit from appellee bank indicated in the deed of assignment. At
the time the assignment was executed, there was no obligation
to be extinguished except the amount of P10,000. Moreover, in
order that an obligation may be extinguished by another which
substitutes the same, it is imperative that it is so declared in
unequivocal terms, or that the old and the new obligations be on
every point incompatible with each other. Obviously, the deed
of assignment was intended as collateral security for the bank
loans of appellants, as a continuing guaranty for whatever sums
would be owing by defendants to plaintiff.

Filoil Marketing Corp- (now Petrophil Corp.)
v. IAC and Josefina Alberto De Pabalan
GR 67115, Jan. 20, 1989
Corporations and businessmen should exercise more
fairness in dealing with ordinary persons, especially if they do
not have the assistance and advice of counsel. Such persons are
not likely to read the fine print in a contract or to understand the
instruments they are signing unless they are properly informed
of the implications of their unsuspecting and heedless acts.
This is not to say that such instruments are per se invalid
without such explanation. What it simply means is that in proper
cases, contracts should be read in the light of the layman’s
understanding of their esoteric legal language, that they may
not ensnare him, because of his trusting lack of caution, in their
intricate stipulations.
Baliwag Transit v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 80447, Jan. 31, 1989

The phraseology “any and all claims or causes of action”

injured party arising from the unfortunate accident.

Lucio Tan Alim v. Court of Appeals
GR 93213, Aug. 9, 1991

FACTS: Pacific Coast Timber Products, Inc., as lessor,
entered into a contract of lease with option to buy, with Lucio
Tan Alim, as lessee, for a term of 15 months over a unit of tractor
at a monthly rental of PIO,000, subject to the stipulation that
after payment of five months, the lessee is given the option to
buy the equipment at P15.000, in which event the rental paid
shall be considered as part of the consideration and that the
equipment has to remain at the lessee’s jobsite. However, upon
its delivery, the tractor was discovered to be defective. So Alim
told Pacific’s manager of such fact, relaying also the need for
the tractor’s reconditioning or replacement with another unit
in good running condition and the immediate repair thereof
as may be arranged by him with the Manila Office. Later, the
parties amended the lease contract, with Alim’s obligation to
execute a Deed of Chattel Mortgage for his three motor vehicles
in favor of Pacific to guarantee his undertaking in the amended
732

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1370

lease contract. Pacific’s lawyer informed Alim that under the

amended contract wherein payments of rentals started in Aug.

1977, the latter failed to pay rentals for seven months in the
amount of P70,000, for which reason the contract of lease, as
well as the option to buy, are automatically terminated. The
lawyer also sent a notice of default in obligation secured by the
Chattel Mortgage. However, the Sheriff returned, unsatisfied, a
petition for extrajudicial foreclosure thereon. Thereafter, Pacific
filed a complaint for recovery of possession with replevin (of a
unit of tractor) due to Alim’s refusal to pay the arrears and to
deliver the equipment. Upon the filing of a bond by Pacific, in
the sum of P300.000, the trial court issued a writ of replevin
for the seizure and delivery of the property on April 13, 1978.
The Sheriff seized the tractor from Alim and turned it over to
Pacific on April 26, 1978. On the scheduled hearing of July 14,
1981, both parties failed to attend. Hence, the dismissal of the
case. However, the order of dismissal was reconsidered upon
explanation of the parties. The case was finally resolved in
favor of Alim on July 31, 1985 by the trial court. The decision
was later modified by the trial court. Alim appealed, claiming
damages because of the wrongful seizure of the tractor, but the
Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the trial court’s decision, denying
the claim for compensation.
ISSUE: Whether or not the 15-month lease period had
commenced from Aug. 1977 and expired in Oct. 1978.
HELD: Both the trial court and the CA are of the view
that no amendment as to the duration of the contract of lease
existed; that the contract expired as originally stipulated on
April 5, 1978 and that the tractor was seized by virtue of a writ
of replevin on Aug. 16, 1978, the contract of lease had expired
and the lessee Alim was consequently not entitled to damages
In the original contract, it was expressly stipulated that the
lease shall be for a period of fifteen months and that the lessee
is given an option to purchase the equipment for one hundred
fifty thousand pesos, after Alim has completed and religiously
paid the five-month rentals which shall be considered as part
of the payment of the consideration.
Upon the other hand, there is no provision in the amended
contract as to the period of lease. Instead, it provides that “all
provisions of the original lease contract not amended by the

733

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1370

foregoing provision shall remain in full force and effect. The
alteration is evidently focused on the period for the right to
exercise the option to buy. Originally, the period was five months,
unquestionably including the period from commencement of
the original contract on Jan. 7, 1977, as specifically provided
in paragraph 4 thereof, which states: “The monthly rentals
of the equipment which on the date of the execution of this
amendment of the original lease contract have not been paid
shall be considered as paid obligation of lessee to lessor, the
payment of which will be the subject of negotiation between
lessor and lessee.” The letter of Pacific’s counsel, on which
Alim heavily relied in his arguments in his favor, confirms the
fact of non-extension of the lease agreement when he spoke of
the commencement of the payment of the rentals, not on the
commencement of the new period of lease. Inevitably, the courts
cannot go beyond what appears in the documents submitted by
the parties. Thus, there is no merit in Alim’s allegation that the
seizure was wrongful for which he must be compensated. The
ownership or right of possession over the equipment belonged to
Pacific at the time it was seized. The seizure of the equipment
was ordered by the trial court for its restoration by means
established in the laws of procedure. Thus, the requisites for
the issuance of the writ of replevin have been satisfied. (Sec. 2,
Rule 60, Revised Rules of Court)

Mojica v. Court of Appeals
GR 94247, Sept. 11, 1991

Contracts which are not ambiguous are to be interpreted
according to their literal meaning and should not be interpreted
beyond their obvious intendment. Thus, where the intent
of the parties has been shown unmistakably with clarity
by the language used, the literal meaning shall control.
Correspondingly, stipulations in the mortgage document
constitute the law between the parties, which must be complied
with faithfully.

Republic v. Sandiganbayan
GR 9067, Nov. 5, 1991

When the words of a contract are plain and readily
understandable, there is no room for construction. Where the
parties’ agreement has been reduced to writing, the rule applies
734

terms and there can be between the parties and their successorsin-interest no evidence of the terms of the agreement other than
the contents of the writing.

Oil & Natural Gas Commission v.

GR 114323, July 23, 1998
The doctrine of noscitur a sociis, although a rule in
the construction of statutes, is equally applicable in the
ascertainment of the meaning and scope of vague contractual
stipulations.
According to the maxim, where a particular word or
phrase is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible of various
meanings, its correct construction may be made clear and specific
by considering the company of the words in which it is found or
with which it is associated, or stated differently, its obscurity
or doubt may be reviewed by reference to associated words.
Petrophil Corp. v. Court of Appeals
GR 122796, Dec. 10, 2001

FACTS: The contract provided for causes for termination,
although it also stated that the contract was for an indefinite
term subject to the right of petitioner to terminate it any time
after a written notice of 30 days.
HELD: The contract clearly provided for two ways of
terminating the contract, and, one mode does not exclude the

other.

When the language of a contract is clear, it requires no
interpretation. The finding that the termination of the contract
was “for cause,” is immaterial. When petitioner terminated the
contract “without cause,” it was required only to give private
respondent a 30-day prior written notice, which it did in this

case.

Manila Bankers Life Insurance Corp. v. Aban

Alpha Insurance & Surety Co. v. Castor
704 SCRA 550

In interpreting the inclusions in an insurance contract,
the terms used specifying the excluded classes therein are to
be given the meaning as understood in common speech.
Because an insurance contract is a contract of adhesion,
it only means that when the terms of said insurance contract
contain limitations on liability, courts should construe them in
such a manner as to preclude the insurer from non-compliance
with his obligation.
(4) Why Monetary Claims under a 'Construction Contract’

Are Disputes Arising from ‘Differences in Interpretation
of the Contract’

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1371

ANS: No. (Steamship Mutual Underwriting Assoc. [Ber¬
muda] Ltd. v Sulpicio Lines, Inc., 840 SCRA 203 [2017]) Article

1370 of the Civil Code is categorical that when -

“the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon
the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning
of its stipulations shall control.” (International Exchange
Bank [now Union Bank] v. Briones, 822 SCRA 103 [2017])

Art. 1371. In order to judge the intention of the contracting
parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be
principally considered.

COMMENT:
(1) How to Judge Intent of the Parties

If the parties have themselves placed an interpretation to
the terms of their contract, such interpretation must in
general be followed. (Valdez v. Sibal, 46 Phil. 930)
(b) The contract of the parties may result in estoppel. (Arts.
1431-1439, Civil Code)
(c) The courts may consider the relations existing between
the parties and the purpose of the contract, particularly
when it was made in good faith between mutual friends.
(Kidwell v. Cartes, 43 Phil. 953)
(a)

The Manila Insurance Co., Inc. v. Amurao
688 SCRA 609

The rationale is because

—

“the matter of ascertaining the duties and obligations of
the parties under contract all involve interpretation of the
provisions of the contract.”
(5) Query

What are “monetary claims" under a construction contract?
ANS.: These are disputes arising from

—

“differences in interpretation of the contract [because] the
matter of ascertaining the duties and obligations of the
parties under their contract all involve interpretation of
the contract.” (The Manila Insurance Co., Inc. v. Amurao,
688 SCRA 609)
(6) Another Query

When the text of a contract is explicit end bears no doubt
as to its intention, may the court read into it any other intention
that would contradict its plain import?
736

(2) Cases

Manila Electric Co. v. Commissioners
30 Phil. 387
FACTS: When the Meralco obtained a franchise from the
City of Manila, free transportation was granted in the franchise
to employees of the City of Manila “wearing official badges.”
The question to determine is: What should be the proper
interpretation of “wearing,” wearing so that it could be seen, or
wearing the badge, without the badge being seen? Or should the
term include both? To properly solve the question, the Supreme
Court had to look into the actions of the contracting parties at
the time of and subsequent to the granting of the franchise. It
was proved to the satisfaction of the court that for nine years
737

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1371

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the parties interpreted the phrase to mean “the wearing of the
official badges so that they could be seen.”
HELD: Such interpretation of the parties should be the
interpretation by the court, because “the courts are NOT at
liberty to adopt a construction opposed to that which the parties
have placed on their contract."
Aurora Capulong v. Court of Appeals
L-61337, June 29, 1984
If two documents are executed on the same day by the
same parties one being an absolute sale, and the other, an
option to repurchase, the two documents will be considered as
one contract, namely, a sale with the right of redemption.

—

Weldon Construction Corp. v. Court of Appeals
GR 35721, Oct. 12, 1987

Acts done by the parties to a contract in the course of its
performance are admissible in evidence upon the question of
meaning as being their own contemporaneous interpretation
of its terms.
(3) Some Observations

As a general rule, when the terms of a contract are clear
and unambiguous about the intention of the contracting parties,
the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control. But if the
words appear to contravene the evident intention of the parties,
the latter shall prevail over the former. (Art. 1370) The real
nature of a contract may be determined from the express terms
of the agreement, as well as from the contemporaneous and
subsequent acts of the parties thereto. (Art. 1371) (Cruz v. CA,
293 SCRA 239 [1998]; Sicad v. CA, 294 SCRA 183 [1998]; and
People’s Aircargo & Warehouse Co., Inc. v. CA, 297 SCRA 170
[1998])

Upon the other hand, simulation takes place when the
parties do not really want the contract they have executed to
produce the legal effects expressed by its wordings. (Villaflor v.
CA, 280 SCRA 297 [1997]; Tongoy v. CA, 123 SCRA 99 [1983];
and Rodriguez u. Rodriguez, 20 SCRA 908 [1967]) Simulation
or vices of declaration may be either “absolute” or “relative."
738

,

Art. 1372

Article 1345 distinguishes an absolute simulation from a relative
one while Art. 1346 discusses their effects. Stated in another
modality, an absolutely simulated contract of sale is void ab
initio and transfer no ownership right. The purported buyer, not
being the owner, cannot validly mortgage the subject property.
Consequently, neither does the buyer at the foreclosure sale
acquire any title thereto. (Edilberto Cruz and Simplicio Cruz u.
Bancom Finance Corp. [Union Bank of the Phils.], GR 147788,
March 19, 2002)

(4) ‘Parol Evidence Rule’

It is well-settled that parol evidence can serve the purpose
of incorporating into the contract additional contemporaneous
conditions, which are not mentioned at all in writing, only if
there is fraud or mistake. (Felix Plaza Urban Poor Settlers
Community Asso. Inc. v. Lipat, Sr., 821 SCRA 12 [2017])
In Mancol, Jr. v. DBP (846 SCRA 131 [2017]), the Supreme
Court pronounced that the parol evidence rule forbids any addi¬
tion to, or contradiction of the terms of a written agreement by
testimony or other evidence purporting to show that different
terms were agreed upon by the parties, varying the purport of
the written contract.
Art. 1372. However general the terms of a contract may
be, they shall be understood to comprehend things that are
distinct and cases that are different from those upon which
the parties intended to agree.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of the Use of General Terms

Example:
A sold B his house including “all the furniture therein.”
Suppose part of the furniture belonged to a relative of A who had
asked him (A) for permission to leave them there temporarily,
should such furniture be included?
ANS.: No, such furniture should not be included, because
although the term “all* is general, still it should “not be
understood to comprehend things that are distinct and cases
739

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1372

that are different from those upon which the parties intended
to agree.” (Art. 1372, Civil Code)
In one case, the Supreme Court said: “Considering that
the land of the applicant was not the subject of the contract,
and that it could not be so for the reason that it did not belong
to the vendor, it can in no wise be understood as included in the
instrument of sale which appears at folio 66, no matter what
may be the terms of the document.” (Reyes v. Limjap, 15 Phil.
420)

(2) Cases

Phil. Trust Co. v. Echaus
52 Phil. 852
FACTS: A mortgaged his land to C to secure or guarantee
B’s debt. B could not pay, so the mortgage was foreclosed, but

there was a deficiency.
ISSUE: Is A responsible personally for the deficiency?
HELD: No, because it was only his land that was offered
as security.

NAESS Shipping Phils., Inc. v. NLRC
GR 73441, Sept. 4, 1987
FACTS: D had been hired by NAESS to serve aboard a
ship under an employment contract which incorporated as
part thereof the Special Agreement between the International
Workers Federation and NAESS. Said agreement bound NAESS
to pay cash benefits for loss of life to workers enrolled therein
pursuant to the following provisions:
“Par. 17 Cash benefits
Compensation for loss of life:
i)
To each dependent child $24,844.00.
US
ii) To each dependent child under the age of 18
$7,118."
One night, while on board the vessel of NAESS, D fatally
stabbed the second cook during a quarrel, then ran to the deck
from which he jumped or fell overboard. He was never seen
again despite diligent search. NAESS denied liability on the

—

740

—

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1373

ground that D had taken his own life and that suicide was not
compensable under the agreement invoked. The POEA rendered
judgment for the heirs ofD, holding O’s death compensable under
the agreement. The NLRC sustained the POEA The Supreme
Court upheld the decision.

HELD: It makes no difference whether D intentionally
took his own life, or he killed himself in a moment of temporary
aberration triggered by remorse over the killing of the second
cook, or he accidentally fell overboard while trying to flee from
an imagined pursuit. It is only logical to assume that if it had
been intended to subject NAESS’ liability for death benefits to
any condition, such as one barring compensation for death by
the employee’s own hand, whether intentional or otherwise, the
contract would have specifically so provided. No law or rule has
been cited which would make illegal for an employer to assume
such obligation in favor of his or its employee in their contract of
employment. In any case, the Court is not prepared to rule that
a contract contravenes public policy and is therefore void which,
by not specifically excepting suicide in a clause obligating one of
the parties to pay compensation for the death of the other, may
in theory enable the latter’s estate, or his heirs, to profit from
his self-immolation.
(3) Special Intent Prevails over a General Intent

Just as a special provision controls a general provision, a
special intent prevails over a general intent. (Hibberd v. Estate
of McElroy, 25 Phil. 164)
Art. 1373. If some stipulation of any contract should admit
of several meanings, it shall be understood as bearing that
import which is most adequate to render it effectuaL

COMMENT:
(1) Stipulation Admitting of Several Meanings

Example:
A wife exchanged “her house” for a diamond ring. Now
the wife had a house which was her paraphernal property,
and another house, which, however, belonged to the conjugal
741

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1374

partnership. The contract entered into by the wife was against
the consent of the husband. To which house should “her house”
refer?

ANS.: It should refer to her paraphernal house, because this
would validate the contract. If the other interpretation would
be followed, the exchange would not be valid since the husband
had not given consent.
(2) Effect of an Interpretation Upholding the Validity of the

Contract
If one interpretation makes a contract valid and illegal, the
former interpretation must prevail. (Luna v. Linatoc, 74 Phil.
15)

Art. 1374. The various stipulations of a contract shall be
interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that
sense which may result from all of them taken jointly.

COMMENT:
Stipulations to Be Read Together

Bank of the P.I. v. Ty Cameo Sobrino
57 Phil. 801
FACTS: A mortgaged his property to B. In the contract, it
was stated that a second mortgage was prohibited, except with
the written consent of B. The contract further stated that the
penalty for such a violation would be that B can immediately
foreclose the mortgage. Without the consent of B, A mortgaged
the property a second time to C. Has B the right to consider the
second mortgage null and void?
HELD: No, B has no right to consider the second mortgage
null and void. His only right is to foreclose the first mortgage
right now. The whole mortgage contract must be read. Said the
Supreme Court:

“The mortgage contract should be read in its entirety. If
so read, it is at once seen that while the making of the second
mortgage except with the written consent of the mortgagee is
prohibited, the contract continues and states the penalty for
742

Art. 1374

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

such a violation, namely, it gives the mortgagee (B) the right
to immediately foreclose the mortgage. It does not give the
mortgagee the right to treat the second mortgage as null and
void.”

North Negros Sugar Co. v.
Compania Gen. de Tabacos
L-9277, March 29, 1957

FACTS: A seller sold copra in his bodega to a buyer, to
whom he issued a quedan (a document authorizing the buyer
to get the copra therein, and giving its disposal to the buyer).
However, in a letter that accompanied the quedan, the seller
reserved the right to get the copra from its other bodegas. The
question at issue was whether or not, in the face of the two
conflicting provisions, delivery of the copra in the first bodega
had really been made upon the issuance of the quedan.

HELD: The various stipulations in a contract must be read
together to give effect to all. Thus, to reconcile them, the proper
interpretation is this: delivery of the copra was in fact made
upon the delivery of the quedan, but said delivery was subject
to the right of the seller to substitute the same with copra from
the other bodegas.

Shell Co. v. Firemen’s Ins., etc., et al.
L-8169, Jan. 29, 1957

ISSUE: If there should be a controversy as to what the
parties really intended to enter into, what should prevail, the
name given to the contract by the contracting parties or the way
the parties performed their respective obligations?
HELD: The latter prevails, for performance more clearly
indicates their intention than the name or title given the contract
by the parties.
ISSUE: Whenever one contract is incorporated into
another, how should both contracts be interpreted?

HELD: Complementary contracts must of course be
construed together so as to give effect as much as possible to
the provisions of both agreements.

Despite the fact that the terms are presumed to have
been used in their primary and general acceptation, may other
meanings or significations be proved?

ANS.: Yes. “Evidence is admissible to show that they have
a local, technical or otherwise peculiar signification, and were so
used and understood in the particular instance, in which case
the agreement must be construed accordingly.” (Sec. 12, Rule
130, Revised Rules of Court)

Art. 1376. The usage or custom of the place shall be borne

and shall fill the omission of stipulations which are ordinarily

established.

Example:

If authority is given “to exact payment by legal
means,” does this include authority to file actions in court
for the recovery of sums of money?
ANS.: Yes. The clause in question means “the power
to exact payment of debts due the concerned by means of
the institution of suits for their recovery. If there could
be any doubt as to the meaning of this language taken by
itself, it would be removed by a consideration of the general
scope and purpose of the instrument in which it concurs.”

held that the term “pesetas" should be construed to mean
Mexican pesetas. (Yafiez de Barnuevo v. Faster, 29 Phil.

(b)

If a contract for a lease of services does not state how much

745

Art. 1377

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If the customs and the usages are merely local, then they
have to be both alleged (pleaded) and proved.
[NOTE: The Supreme Court has made the following
observation: “If a custom be general in character, and therefore
presumed to be known by the parties, the rule is that such
custom may be proved without being specifically pleaded. This
is particularly true when a general custom is offered in evidence
to throw light upon a contract, the terms of which are obscure,
and which is dependent upon evidence of such general custom
to make it plain. If, on the other hand, the customs be local in
character, the party who proposes to rely upon it should aver it
in his pleadings, and a local custom or usage applying to a special
or particular kind of business (like the custom of “discounting
notes”) may not be proved to explain even the ambiguous
terms
of a contract, unless the existence of such custom or usage is
pleaded.” (Andreas v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, 47 Phil.

795)}

Art. 1377. The interpretation of obscure words or
stipulations in a contract shall not favor the party who caused
the obscurity.

COMMENT:
(1) Interpretation to Be Against Party Who Caused Obscurity

Heasons for the law: Since he caused the obscurity, the
party who drew up the contract with ambiguous terms should be
responsible therefor; so the obscurity must be construed against
him. (Gonzales v. La Provisora Filipina, 74 Phil. 165) The drafter
of the terms of the contract should, therefore, be careful.
(2) Cases
Gov’t, of the Phil. v. Derham Bros.

the antecedent of 'its” was the street. Upon the other hand, the
contractor said that “its” referred throughout the length of the
real property (and not the whole street) should be metalled. It
was the government that drafted the contract.
ISSUE: Who is correct, the government or the contractor?
HELD: The contractor is correct. It was the government
that cause the ambiguity, so the interpretation of “its” should not
be in the government’s favor and, therefore, it may be concluded
that it was not intended by the contracting parties that the whole
street would be metalled. When different interpretations of a

provision are otherwise equally proper, that construction is to
be taken which is the most favorable to the party in whose favor
the provision was made, and did not cause the ambiguity.
Enriquez v. A.S. Watson and Co.
22 Phil. 623

FACTS: In a contract of lease, it was provided that the
lessee could make “obras” (improvements) on the property of
the lessor without the necessity of asking the lessor’s permission
every time an improvement is to be made. The lessee demolished
an old wall and erected one of reinforced concrete in its place.
The lessor is now blaming the lessee for having demolished the
old wall, claiming that the lessee was allowed to make only
improvements, not demolitions.
ISSUE: Did the demolition of the old one and its substitution
by a new one constitute “improvements” or "obras*?
HELD: The term “obras” or “improvements” is susceptible
of different interpretations, and since the ambiguity here was
caused by the lessor, the term should not be interpreted in his
favor. Hence, it was all right for the lessee to do what he did.

36 Phil. 960

FACTS: In a contract, it was agreed that a metalled
roadway would be built on the street where the real property
was located to “its entire length.” Now the pronoun “its* may
refer either to the street or the real property. The government
contended that the whole street should be metalled, alleging that

Pao Chuan Wei v. Romerosa and
General Indemnity Co., Inc.
L-10292, Feb. 28, 1958

FACTS: A surety bond agreement provided that the surety
“will not be liable for any claim not discovered and presented
to the company within three months from the expiration of the
bond, and that the obligee waives his right to file any court action
747

Art. 1377

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

against the surety after the termination of the three months

aforementioned

ISSUE: If a claim is presented within three months, may
a court action be still instituted after said three months?
HELD: Yes, in view of the following reasons:
To hold that the prescriptive period should be only three
months would be unreasonable and absurd for if a claim
is presented to the Company, say on the last day of the
period, the Company would still have to approve or deny
the claim. If we will hold that said day would also be the
last day to file a case in court, clearly the Company is not
given the chance to approve or to deny; and the obligee is
given very little time to file a court claim. This could not
have been the intention of the parties.
(2) If a stipulation in a surety bond can be interpreted as a
condition precedent (preparatory to a court suit), or as both
a condition precedent and prescription, the ambiguity, if
any, must be interpreted against the surety who prepared
the form on which the bond was executed.

Lucio Tan v. Court of Appeals & Sanchez
GR 100942, Aug. 12, 1992
The private respondent correctly observes that it
would have been a simple matter for the promisor to
state clearly in the promissory note that he would pay
the balance of P50.000 only on condition that he would
continue to manage and operate the restaurant during that
two-year period of the lease. He did not see fit to include
this condition in the promissory note he signed.
Assuming an ambiguity in the instrument, Art. 1377
of the Civil Code is applied in that the ambiguity must be
resolved against the person who caused it, in this case, the
promisor.

Finman Gen. Ass. Corp. v. Court of Appeals
& Surposa
GR 100970, Sept. 2, 1992
FACTS: Deceased Carlie Surposa was insured
with petitioner Finman General Assurance Corp, with
748

Art. 1377

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

—

all surnamed Surposa, as
his parents and brothers
beneficiaries. While said insurance policy was in full force
and effect, the insured died on Oct. 18, 1988 as a result
of a stab wound inflicted by one of three unidentified men
without provocation and warning on the part of the former
as he and his cousin were waiting for a ride on their way
home after attending the celebration of the “Maskara
Annual Festival.” Thereafter, private respondent and the
other beneficiaries of said insurance policy filed a written
notice of the claim with the petitioner insurance company
which denied said claim, contending that “murder” and
“assault” are not within the scope of the coverage of the
insurance policy.
HELD: The insurance company is liable to pay
respondent and the other beneficiaries the sum of P15.000
representing the proceeds of the policy with interest. The
the
principle of expresso unius est exclusio alterius
mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another
thing is, therefore, applicable in the instant case since
murder and assault, not having been expressly included in
the enumeration of the circumstances that would negate
liability in said insurance policy, cannot be considered by
implication to discharge the petitioner insurance company
from liability for any injury, disability or loss suffered
by the insured. The failure of the petitioner insurance
company to include death resulting from murder or
assault among the prohibited risks leads inevitably to the
conclusion that it did not intend to limit or exempt itself
from liability for such death. Thus, Art. 1377 of the Civil
Code provides that “[t]he interpretation of obscure words
on stipulations in a contract shall not favor the party who
caused the obscurity.” Moreover, it is well-settled that
contracts of insurance are to be construed Uberally in favor
of the insured and strictly against the insurer. Ambiguity
in the words of an insurance contract should be interpreted
in favor of its beneficiary.

(3) Rule in Contracts of Adhesion

Article 1337 of the Civil Code apphes with even greater
force in contracts of adhesion where the contract is already
749

Art. 1377

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

prepared by a big concern, and the other party merely adheres
to it, like insurance or transportation contracts, or bills of lading.
(See 6 R.C.L. 854; see also Qua Chee Gan v. La Union & Rock,
Co., Inc. Co., Ltd., 98 Phil. 85)

Example: Obscure terms in an insurance policy are
construed strictly against the insurer, and liberally in favor
of the insured. This is to effectuate the dominant purpose of
insurance indemnification. This indeed is particularly true in
cases where forfeiture is involved. (Calanoc v. Court of Appeals,
98 Phil. 79)

National Power Corp. v. Court of Appeals
GR 43706, Nov. 14, 1986
Contracts of insurance are to be construed liberally in favor
of the insured and strictly against the insurer. Thus, ambiguity
in the words of the insurance contract should be interpreted in

favor of its beneficiary.

Phil. American Gen. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Lines, Inc.
GR 87434, Aug. 5, 1992

Contracts of adhesion wherein one party imposes a ready¬
made form of contract on the other are contracts not entirely
prohibited. The one who adheres to the contract is in reality free
to reject it entirely; if he adheres, he gives his consent.
In the present case, not even an allegation of ignorance of a
party excuses non-compliance with the contractual stipulations
since the responsibility for ensuring full comprehension of the
provisions of a contract of carriage devolves not on the carrier but
on the owner, shipper, or consignee, as the case may be. Thus,
while it is true that substantial compliance with provisions on
filing of claim for loss of, or damage to, cargo may sometimes
suffice, the invocation of such an assumption must be viewed
vis-a-vis the object or purpose which such a provision seeks to
attain, and that is to afford the carrier a reasonable opportunity
to determine the merits and validity of the claim and to protect
itself against unfounded impositions.

(4) A Credit Card Membership Is a Contract of Adhesion

Pantaleon v. American Express International,
Inc. (AMEX)
629 SCRA 276 (2010)
ISSUES: (1) Is a credit card membership agreement a
contract of adhesion?; (2) Is the AMEX bound to act on its
cardholders’ purchase requests with any specific period of time?;
(3) Is a practice or custom a source of legally-demandable as
enforceable right?; (4) Define what a credit card is, and trace
briefly its etymological roots.

HELD: (1) Yes, inasmuch as its terms are prepared solely
by the credit card issuer, with the cardholder merely affixing
his signature signifying his adhesion to these terms.
Under Philippine jurisdictions, the general adhered rule
allows for the recognition of the relationship between the credit
card issuer and the credit card holder as a contractual one
that is governed by the terms and conditions found in the card
membership agreement.
Every credit card transaction involves three contracts:
(1) the sales contract; (2) the loan agreement; and (3) the promise
to pay. In more concrete terms, when cardholders are their credit
cards to pay for their purchases, they merely offer to enter into
loan agreements with the credit card company - only after the
latter approves the purchase requests that the parties enter into
binding loan contracts.
(2) No. The Court holds that AMEX is neither contrac¬
tually bound nor legally obligated to act on its cardholders’
purchase requests within any specific period of time, much less
a period of a “matter of seconds” the standard, therefore, is
implicit and, as in all contracts, must be based on fairness and
reasonableness, read in relation to the Civil Code provisions on

-

human relations.
In the context of a credit card relationships, although there
is neither a contractual stipulations nor a specific law requiring
the credit card issuer to act on the credit card holder’s offer
within a definite period of time, the principles set out in
Art. 19 of the Civil Code provide the standard by which to judge
the credit card company’s actions.
751

Art. 1378

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(3) No, as a general rule. Now, even if the cardholder did
prove that the credit card company, as a matter of practice in
custom, acted on its customers’ purchase requests in a matter
of seconds, this would still not be enough to establish a legallydemandable right. Besides, a survey of Philippine law on credit
card transactions demonstrates that the State does not require
its cardholders’ purchase requests within a specific period of

time.
(4)

A credit card is defined as

—

“any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device
existing for the purpose of obtaining money, goods,
property, labor, or services as anything of value on credit.”

It traces its roots to the charge card first introduced by the
Diners Club in New York City in 1950. In the Philippines, the
non-defunct Pacific Bank was responsible for bringing the first
credit card into the country in the 1970s.
Art. 1378. When it is absolutely impossible to settle
doubts by the rules established in the preceding articles, and
the doubts refer to incidental circumstances of a gratuitous
contract, the least transmission of rights and interests shall
prevail. If the contract is onerous, the doubt shall be settled
in favor of the greatest reciprocity of interests.

If the doubts are cast upon the principal object of the
contract in such a way that it cannot be known what may have
been the intention or will of the parties, the contract shall be
null and void.

COMMENT:
( 1 ) Doubts as to Principal Object or Incidental Circumstances

There may be doubts as to:
(a)

the principal object

(b)

or the incidental circumstances (as to whether, for example,
a sale or a mortgage is involved)

752

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1378

(2) Doubt as to the Principal Object

Here, the contract is void.
Example: X promised to give Y this (
). Since
the object is unknown, it is clear that there could not have been
any meeting of the minds.
(8) Doubts as to the Incidental Circumstances

Apply the following rules:
(a)

If gratuitous, apply the rule of “least transmission of rights
and interest.”

(b)

If onerous, apply the rule of the “greatest reciprocity of
interests.”
Example: If A needs a fountain pen and B gives it
to him freely (gratuitously), is this a mere donation or a
commodatum?
ANS.: A mere commodatum (loan) for this would
transmit lesser rights than a donation.
Another example: It is fairer, in case of doubt, to
interpret a mortgage contract as one which is gratuitous
rather than one which is onerous. (Bruiser v. Cabrera, 81
Phil. 669)

Another example: If a pacto de retro contract is not
clear as to exactly when redemption has to be made, we
should interpret the period as an indefinite one (hence, the
maximum period is ten years, rather than four years). This
is important to effectuate the least transmission of rights.
(Tumaneng v. Abad, 92 Phil. 18)
Another example: When what has been received for
his house by a person needing money is very much less
than the value of the house, the courts will be inclined to
interpret the transaction more as an equitable mortgage,
than as a sale with the right of repurchase, the reason being
that in an equitable mortgage, there is in this case greater
reciprocity of interests, considering the amount of money
received. Said the Supreme Court: “Even if there were a
753

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1378

doubt as to whether the contract entered into by Vicente
Perez was one of mortgage or one of sale, on the hypothesis
that he could dispose of the property, while it is not possible
to decide the question by the language of the document,
in justice, it must be assumed that the debtor assumed a
lesser obligation, and that in accord with the creditor he
bound himself to execute a mortgage which has a greater
reciprocity of interests than a contract of sale under pacto
de retro, in spite of the fact that both the latter and that of
mortgage involve a valuable consideration in accordance
with the provisions of Art. 1289 of the Civil Code” (now Art.
1378 of the new Civil Code). (Perez v. Cortez, 15 Phil. 211)
Olino v. Medina
13 Phil. 379

FACTS: A was indebted to B for Pl 75. Because A had
no money, C offered to pay, and actually paid P175 to B.
Because he was grateful, A consented to the transfer of his
land to C.
ISSUE: Is this to be considered as a sale, or as a mere
loan with the land as security?
HELD: This should be considered as a mere loan with
the land as security instead of a sale to C, inasmuch as the
former involves both the lesser transmission of rights as
well as greater reciprocity of interest. Said the Supreme
Court: “Inasmuch as we are in doubt as to which of the two
contracts it was by reason of which Medina (C) furnished
the P175, with which Olino (A) redeemed his land from
Isidora Rendon (B), and Olino in turn consented to the
transfer of the land to Medina, the party who furnished
the money, we elect to consider that said contract was
that of loan, because such a contract involves a smaller
transmission of rights and interest, and the debtor does
not surrender all rights to his property, but simply confers
upon the creditors the right to collect what is owing from
the value of the thing given as security, there existing
between the parties a greater reciprocity of rights and
obligations.”
754

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1379

Art. 1379. The principles of interpretation stated in Rule
123 of the Rules of Court shall likewise be observed in the
construction of contracts.

COMMENT:
(1) Suppletory Use of the Principles of Interpretation in the

Rules of Court

Rule 123 as stated in the Article should be construed to
refer to Rule 130 of the New Rules on Evidence.
(2) Language in the Place of Execution

“The language of a writing is to be interpreted according
to the legal meaning it bears in the place of its execution, unless
the parties intended otherwise.” (Sec. 8, Rule 130, Revised Rules

of Court)

(3) Meaning of Words Used

“The terms of a writing are presumed to have been used
in their primary and general acceptation, but evidence is
admissible to show that they have a local, technical, or otherwise
peculiar signification, and were so used and understood in the
particular instance, in which case, the agreement must be
construed accordingly.” (Sec. 12, Rule 130, Revised Rules of

Court)

(4) Conflict between Printed and Written (Not Printed)

Words

“When an instrument consists partly of written words and
partly of a printed form, and the two are inconsistent, the former
controls the latter.” (Sec. 13, Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court)
Jarque v. Smith, Bell and Co.
56 Phil. 758

FACTS: A insured his ship with an insurance company. In
the printed policy, the vessel is supposed to be insured against
loss. But attached to the policy is a “rider,” a typewritten clause
which states that the insurance is only against absolute total loss
of the vessel only, and that the insurance company was supposed
755

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1379

to pay only the proportionate salvage charges of the declared
value. At the bottom of said rider are found the words “Attaching
to and forming part of the National Union Fire Insurance Co.,
Hull Policy No. 1055.”

Chapter 6

ISSUE: Which should prevail, the printed words or the
typed “rider”?
HELD: “It is a well-settled rule that in case repugnance
exists between written and printed portions of a policy, the
written portion prevails, and there can be no question that as
far as any inconsistency exists, the abovementioned typed ‘rider’
prevails over the printed clause.”

(5) Use of Experts and Interpreters

RESCISSIBLE CONTRACTS
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
(1) The Four Kinds of Defective Contracts

There are four kinds of defective contracts (contracts which

may be invalidated):

“When the characters in which an instrument is written
are difficult to be deciphered, or the language is not understood
by the Court, the evidence of persons skilled in deciphering the
characters, or who understood the language, is admissible to
declare the characters or the meaning of the language.” (Sec.
14, Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court)

(b)

voidable

(c)

unenforceable

(d)

void (which may be inexistent or illegal)

—

(a)

The rescissible contract is valid until rescinded; there is a
sort of extrinsic defect consisting of an economic damage
or lesion.

(b)

The voidable contract is valid till annulled. It can be
annulled. It cannot be annulled, however, if there has been
a ratification. The defect is more or less intrinsic, as in the
case of vitiated consent.

(c)

The unenforceable contract cannot be sued upon or enforced,
unless it is ratified. In a way, it may be considered as a
validable transaction, that is, it has no effect now, but it
may be effective upon ratification.

[NOTE: The right to redeem is a natural right. (Tumaneng

v. Abad, 92 Phil. 18)]
(7) Usage or Customs

rescissible

[NOTE: In general

(6) Interpretation in Favor of a Natural Right

“When an instrument is equally susceptible of two
interpretations, one in favor of a natural right and the other
against it, the former is to be adopted.” (Sec. 14, Rule 130,
Revised Rules of Court)

(a)

“An instrument may be construed according to usage, in
order to determine its true character.” (Sec. 17, Rule 130, Revised
Rules of Court)

(NOTE: On the other hand, a voidable contract has
effect now, but it may be invalidated; hence, it is deemed
valid unless annulled.)

(d)

756

The void contract is one that has no effect at all; it cannot
be ratified or validated.]

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(2)

[NOTE: The abovenamed defective contracts are
arranged in the order of decreasing validity.]
(2) Comment of the Code Commission

“A great deal of confusion has been created by the faulty
terminology used by the old Code as regards defective contracts
... In order to put an end to the foregoing uncertainty and
other ambiguities in the old Code, the Project of the new Civil
Code, in a clear-cut and unequivocal way, classifies and defines
the various kinds of defective contracts, and states their
consequences. There are four kinds of such contracts, namely:
(1)

rescissible;

(2)
(3)

voidable;
unenforceable;

(4)

void or inexistent contracts.”

“The first class, rescissible, remains as they are found in
the old Code. All the essential requisites of a contract exist and
the contract is valid, but by reason of injury or damage to third
persons, such as creditors, the contract may be rescinded.”
“The second kind, voidable contracts, are specifically set
forth in Art. 1390 of the new Civil Code.”
“Thus, from various sources in Philippine laws and from
decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, a new class
of defective contracts is to a certain extent created. The term
‘unenforceable’ is used, as distinguished from ‘voidable.’ The
latter are binding, unless annulled by proper action in court,
while the former cannot be sued upon or enforced unless they are
ratified. As regard the degree of defectiveness, voidable contracts
are farther away from absolute nullity than unenforceable
contracts. In other words, an unenforceable contract occupies
an intermediate ground between voidable and void contracts.”

“Lastly, there are the void or inexistent contracts. They
are absolutely null and void.”
“It will thus be seen that the various contracts, in the order

(decreasing) of their defectiveness, are the following:
(1)

rescissible
758

Art 1380

voidable

(3)

unenforceable

(4)

void or inexistent.”

“It is believed that with the explicit provisions of the
new Civil Code upon the subject of defective contracts, the old
nebulous state of the law has been dispelled. It is neither wise
nor just that parties should be left in doubt as to the degree of
effectiveness of the contractual relations.”
“The legal profession is entitled to know in a positive and
unequivocal manner what contracts are rescissible, voidable,
unenforceable, and void. It is hoped that this clarification of
the law on this most far-reaching subject will go far toward
forestalling many controversies and litigations.” (Report of the
Code Commission, pp. 138-140)
Art. 1380. Contracts validly agreed upon may be rescinded
in the cases established by law.

COMMENT:
(1) Tiescission’ Defined
(a)

Scaevola:
“Rescission is a process designated to render
inefficacious a contract validly entered into and normally
binding, by reason of external conditions, causing an
economic prejudice to a party or to his creditors.”

(b)

8 Manresa, pp. 748-749:

“Rescission is a remedy granted by law to the
contracting parties both to contracting parties and to third
persons in order to secure reparation of damages caused
them by a contract, even if the contract be valid, by means
of the restoration of things to their condition prior to the
celebration of said contract.”
(c)

Supreme Court:

It is a relief to protect one of the parties or a third
person from all injury and damages which the contract
759

Art. 1380

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

may cause, to protect some preferential right. (See Aquino
v. Tanedo, 39 Phil. 517)
[NOTE: Even a voidable contract may be rescinded,
for example, by prejudiced creditors. This is particularly
true if the injured party does not care to ask for annulment]
(2) Requisites for Rescission
(a)

(b)

There must be at the beginning either a valid or a voidable
contract (not a void one);

But there is an economic or financial prejudice to someone

(a party or a third person);

(c)

Requires mutual restitution.

(3) Two Kinds of Rescission
(a)

The rescission mentioned in Art. 1380 of the New Civil
Code. This is, properly speaking, “rescission."

(b)

The rescission mentioned in Art. 1191 of the New Civil
Code. Although in this Article, the new Code used the
term “rescission," the term, properly speaking, should be

“resolution."

[NOTE:
1)

Rescission in general (Art. 1380)
a)

is based on lesion or fraud upon creditors;

b)

here, the action is instituted by either of the
contracting parties or by third persons;
here, the courts cannot grant a period or term
within which to comply;

c)

d)

2)

here, non-performance by the other party is
immaterial.
Rescission under Art. 1191 (resolution)
a) is based on non-performance or non-fulfillment
of the obligation;
b) here, the action may be instituted only by the
injured party to the contract;
760

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

c)

Art. 1380

here, in some cases, the courts may grant a term;
here, non-performance by the other party is
important.]

Legarda Hermanos v. Suldano
L-26578, Jan. 28, 1974

FACTS: A vendor sold two lots on the installment plan to
a buyer who subsequently was able to pay (in installments) an
amount, which by itself already exceeded the purchase price of
one of the lots. If the buyer does not continue paying, may the
vendor successfully ask for the rescission (actually, resolution)
of the sale of the two lots?
HELD: No, otherwise unfairness would result. Here, the
vendor was ordered to convey to the buyer one of the two lots.
(4) Mutual Dissent

QUERY: Suppose the parties to a contract mutually agreed

to cancel the contract, is this “rescission” properly so-called?
ANS.: No. Of course, in a loose sense “rescission” may be

used here. But strictly speaking, this is “mutual backing out,”
and not the rescission referred to in Art. 1380 of the new Civil
Code. In mutual withdrawal, it is the will of the parties that
constitutes the basis, whereas in rescission (properly called), it
is the law that constitutes the basis.
Authority:

“The rescission of the contract between the plaintiff and
the defendant was not originated by any of the causes specified
in Arts. 1291 and 1292 (now Arts. 1381 and 1382 of the new
Civil Code), nor is it a relief for the purposes sought by these
articles. It is simply another contract for the dissolution of
the previous one, and its effects, in relation to the contract so
dissolved, should be determined by the agreement made by the
parties, or by the application of other legal provisions, but not by
Article 1295 (now Art. 1385 of the new Civil Code) which is not
applicable.” (Aquino v. Tanedo, 39 Phil. 517, which was about a
sale mutually cancelled by both parties. A question arose as to
whether the buyer had to return the fruits, said obligation being
required in an ordinary case for rescission. Here, the Court said
761

Art. 1380

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

that the duty to return the fruits depended on the agreement
of the parties and not on the legal provisions on rescission, and
this is so, even if the parties had erroneously referred to their
act as one of rescission.)

Luneta Motor Co. v. J.B. Richey
(CA) 39 O.G. 1101

FACTS: A bought a car from B, a dealer of cars, on the
installment plan. After a while, A brought back the car to the
shop of B, saying he could not pay for it. B accepted the car and
registered it under its (B's) name. For a long time, B did not
communicate with A and asked for the unpaid balance. Later, A
received an account for the costs of spare parts and for gasoline.
B then brought this action to recover both the unpaid balance
and the new account.
ISSUE: Has A’s obligation been extinguished?

HELD: Yes, A’s obligation has already been extinguished.
True there had been a contract, but in view of what later
happened, said obligation was cancelled.
The contract was perfectly legal and binding. None of the

Noble v. City of Manila
67 Phil. 1
FACTS: The City of Manila has a contract with Noble
stipulating that the City would buy a certain piece of land. It was
also agreed that while the purchase price was not yet paid, the
City would occupy the land as a tenant and would pay rentals
therefor. Later, the City refused to pay the purchase price
asserting that it was excessive considering the amount it had
already paid by way of rentals, and that therefore the contract
should be rescinded because the contract was far more favorable
for Noble than for the City of Manila.
ISSUE: Should rescission be granted?
HELD: No, rescission should not be granted. That the
contract conferred more favors upon one party than upon another
is not a ground for rescission. Besides, even with the rentals
already paid, the purchase price cannot be considered excessive
because the rentals, together with the price, represented
merely a reasonable profit. Of course, even had the profit been
excessive, the excessiveness of the price is by itself not a ground
for rescission because the only grounds for rescission are those
enumerated by the law.

parties should be allowed to disregard it without a legal and
valid ground therefor. Both parties may, however, agree to
rescind (cancel) it. The question to be determined then, is, did
the plaintiff agree to rescind (cancel) the contract? If the vendor
had not agreed or consented to the return of the car, why did it
register the car in its name? Also, if the vendor had not agreed
to rescind (cancel) the contract when the purchaser returned the
car, why did it not require immediately, or within a reasonable
time, the purchaser to pay the unpaid balance of the note, or to
take the car from its shop or premises or to pay storage charges?
The contract was rescinded (cancelled).

(6) Rescissible Contract Is Not a Void Contract

[NOTE: In the above cited case, the use of the term
“rescind” is inexact. What the Court of Appeals should have
said was “cancelled,” in view of the fact that properly speaking,
this type of “rescission” is only “rescission” in the loose sense,
and not the “rescission” spoken of by the law under the chapter
of rescissible contracts.]

(7) Fictitious Contracts Cannot Be Rescinded

762

A rescissible contract is not void; it is valid until rescinded.
Thus, in the meantime, it can convey title. Moreover, a rescissible
contract cannot be attacked collaterally (incidentally) upon
the grounds for rescission in the course of a land registration
case. (A direct action to rescind is required.) To avoid injustice,
however, the court may allow the aggrieved party to register his
reservation of the right to rescind. The reservation may in fact
be noted on the certificates of title. (Borja v. Addison, 44 Phil.

895)

A party brought an action to rescind a fictitious contract.
Is rescission the proper remedy?

ANS.: No, rescission is not the proper remedy because
while the contract here is fictitious and, therefore, null and void,
763

Art. 1380

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

rescission presupposes a valid contract. (Onglengco v. Ozaeta
and Hernandez, 70 Phil. 43)
(8) Extrajudicial Rescission

Marimperio v. Court of Appeals
GR 40234, Dec. 14, 1987

A charter party may be rescinded extrajudicially. A judicial
action for the rescission of a contract is not necessary where
the contract provides that it may be revoked and cancelled for
violation of any of its terms and conditions, “without noting any
protest and without interference by any court or any formality
whatsoever and without prejudice, the Owners may otherwise
have on the Charterers under the Charter.”

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1381

for the same. (Anchor Savings [formerly Anchor Finance and
Investment Corp.] u. Furigay, 693 SCRA 384)
(11) Case

Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. PAP Co.,

Ltd. (Phil. Branch)
703 SCRA 314
Under the Insurance Code, the insurer is entitled to rescind
the insurance contract in case of an alteration in the use or
condition of the thing — insured.

Art. 1381. The following contracts are rescissible:
(1) Those which are entered into by the guardians

(9) Right of First Refusal

Riviera Filipina v. Court of Appeals
GR 117355, April 5, 2002

The prevailing doctrine is that a right of first refusal means
identity of terms and conditions to be offered to the lessee and
all other prospective buyers.
And a contract of sale entered into in violation of a right
of first refusal of another person, while valid, is rescissible.
(10) Effect of Rescission

Gotesco Properties, Inc. v. Ftyardo
692 SCRA 319

ISSUE: Does rescission merely terminate the contract and
release the parties from further obligations to each other?
HELD: No. Additionally, rescission abrogates the contract
from its inception and restores the parties to their original
positions as if no contract has been made.
QUERY: Is the remedy of rescission subsidiary in nature?

ANS.: Yes, for it cannot be instituted except when the party
suffering damage has no other legal means to obtain reparation
764

whenever the wards whom they represent suffer lesion by
more than one-fourth of the value of the things which are the
object thereof;

(2) Those agreed upon in representation of absentees,
if the latter suffer the lesion stated in the preceding number;
(3) Those undertaken in fraud of creditors when the
latter cannot in any other manner collect the claims due them;
(4) Those which refer to things under litigation if
they have been entered into by the defendant without the
knowledge and approval of the litigants or of competent
judicial authority;

(5) All other contracts specially declared by law to be
subject to rescission.

COMMENT:
(1) Enumeration of the Rescissible Contracts
The Article enumerates the various contracts that may be
rescinded.
(2) First Case
(a)

— In Behalf of Wards

—

Lesion damage or injury to the party asking for rescission
(generally, disparity between the price and the value).
765

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1381

(b)

Modem legislation generally does not favor rescission on

account of lesion, because “goods do not have a fixed true
value; value is always variable and fluctuating, being a
function of supply and demand. The modem codes tend to
view lesion of certain proportions (1/4, 1/2, etc.) as merely
raising a presumption of undue influence that vitiates
consent and renders the contract voidable whenever the
lesion is coupled with exploitation by the others. (Cf,
German Civil Code, Art. 138; Mexico, Art. 17)(J.B.L. Reyes,
Observations on the new Civil Code, Lawyer’s Journal,
Jan. 31, 1951,pp. 39-50) Indeed, mere inadequacy of price,
unless shocking to the conscience, is not a sufficient ground
for setting aside a sale, if there is no showing that, in the
event of a resale, a better price can be obtained. (Cu Bie,
et al. v. Court of Appeals; Salvacion S. Tayengco, et al. v.
Conchita Sydecohautea, etal., L-17294 and L-17385, Nov.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(4) Third Case

(a)

The action to rescind contracts made in fraud of creditors
is called “accion pauliana.”

(b)

Requisites before accion pauliana can be brought:

Effect of Contracts Entered into in Behalf of Ward
1)

If an act of ownership, court approval is required;
otherwise, contract is unenforceable (Art. 1403),
whether there is lesion or not.

2)

If merely an act of administration
a)

if with court approval

1)

There must be a creditor who hecame such PRIOR to
the contract sought to be rescinded (whether the party
asking for rescission is a judgment creditor already
or not, is likewise immaterial).

2)

There must be an alienation made subsequent to such
credit.

3)

The party alienating must be in BAD FAITH (that is,
he knew that damages would be caused his creditors
whether or not he intended to cause such damage).
There must be no other remedy for the prejudiced
creditor “inability to collect the claims due them.”
(Thus, rescission is merely a subsidiary remedy) (See
Panlilio v. Victoria, 35 Phil. 706)

4)

—

In Representation of Absentees

Same comment as in the first case.
[NOTE: Another contract which may be rescinded on the
ground of lesion is a partition of inheritance, when the lesion is
1/4 or more for one heir. (Art. 1098, Civil Code)]

766

—

[NOTE: An action to rescind may be brought
even if the debtor has not been judicially declared
insolvent (TS, June 28, 1 912) and even if the creditor
has not yet brought an action to collect his credit. (TS,
Dec. 13, 1914) Since the law makes no distinction,
both secured and unsecured creditors may bring the
action; the important thing is that they be prejudiced.]
[NOTE: Generally, the party desiring to rescind
must show that the conveyance or alienation was
fraudulent. He has the burden of proof, except in the
cases when there is a presumption of fraud. (See Art.
1387, Civil Code; Menzi & Co. v. Bastida, 63 Phil. 16;
and Ayles v. Reyes, 18 Phil. 243)]

valid, regardless of

lesion. (Art. 1386)
b)
if without court approval rescissible, if lesion
is more than one-fourth. (Art. 1381, No. 1)
[NOTE: Example of act of ownership: sale or mortgage
of minor’s land. Example of act of administration: buying
of fertilizers for land cultivation, or materials for repair.]
(3) Second Case

—

“Those Undertaken in Fraud of Creditors,
When the Latter Cannot in Any Other Manner Collect
Claims Due Them”

29, 1965)
(c)

Art. 1381

(c)

Problem:
To defraud his creditor, A sold his house to X. When
however the creditor wanted to collect his credit, somebody
767

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1381

lent A enough money. Should the sale of the house still be
rescinded?
ANS.: No, it should not be rescinded, because here
the creditor can collect the claim due him.
(5) Fourth Case
(a)

— Things in Litigation

Example:
A sues B for recovery of a diamond ring. Pendente lite,
B sells the ring to C without the approval of A or of the
court. The sale to C is rescissible at A’s instance in case A
wins in the original litigation, unless C is in good faith.

(b)

The property is said to be in litigation here after the
defendant has received the service of summons. (TS, Jan.
25, 1913)

(c)

To protect himself, the plaintiff must register his claim in
the registry of property, pending litigation, if the suit is
about real property. This is the notice of lie pendens. The
purpose is to give notice to the whole world. If personal
property is involved, the property may be levied upon by
a writ of preliminary attachment (Secs. 1 and 2, Rule 57,
Revised Rules of Court); or else, it may be placed in the
hands of a receiver. (Rule 59, Revised Rules of Court)

Mortera v. Martinez
14 Phil. 541

FACTS: A piece of land was the subject of a litigation
between Martinez and the Municipality of San Pablo. After the
case had been decided in favor of Martinez, he sold it to another.
ISSUE: Is the sale rescissible on the ground that the
property was in litigation?
HELD: No, the sale cannot be rescinded. True, it had been
the subject of a litigation, but that litigation had already been
decided in favor of Martinez prior to the sale.
(6) Fifth Case

— Other Instances

Examples are agreements referred to in Arts. 1098
(partition), 1189 (result of deterioration), 1526 and 1534 (right

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1382

given to an unpaid seller), and 1539 (sale of real estate) of the
Civil Code. See also Art. 1382.
Art. 1382. Payments made in a state of insolvency for
obligations to whose fulfillment the debtor could not be
compelled at the time they were effected, are also rescissible.

COMMENT:
(1) Premature Payments Made in a State of Insolvency
Two requisites are essential under this Article:
(a) the debtor-payer must have been insolvent (the insolvency
need not be a judicially declared one);
(b) the debt was not yet due and demandable.
[NOTE: Both conditions are required; otherwise, Art.
1382 cannot apply.]
[NOTE: Article 1382 does not exactly speak of a
contract; it refers to a payment; hence, it is not included
under Art. 1381.]
(2) Cases

Asia Banking Corporation v. Corcuera
51 Phil. 781
FACTS: The Lichauco Corporation owed Noble Jose
P70.000. The Corporation was involvent and although the debt
was not yet enforceable, the Corporation gave to Noble Jose
a deed of sale to one of its properties (the value of which was
much greater than the debt) in payments for the debt. At the
same time, the Corporation paid off a certain Corcuera its debt
of P24.000 by giving him a piece of land. This latter debt was
already due and demandable at the time payment was made.
ISSUE: Are the two transactions rescindable?
HELD: The first is rescindable because it was made in a
state of insolvency for an obligation to whose fulfillment the
debtor could not be compelled at the time it was effected. But the
second debt is not rescindable because at the time of payment,
even if the Corporation was already insolvent, the debt was
already due, owing and enforceable.
769

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1383

Pilipinas Bank v. IAC
GR 67881, June 30, 1987

FACTS: HB, Inc. sold to JWD a 5,000 square-meter lot for
sent letters of demand to pay the balance or unpaid installments
and on each occasion, HB, Inc. granted JWD extensions and
never called attention to the proviso on “automatic rescission.”
Finally, HB, Inc. wrote a letter to JWD telling that the contract
to sell had been rescinded/cancelled by a notarial act, to which
letter was annexed a “demand for rescission of contract.” JWD
filed a complaint for specific performance with damages to
compel HB, Inc. to execute a deed of sale in his favor and to
deliver to him the title of the lot in question.
The trial court held that HB, Inc. cannot rescind the
contract to sell because it waived the automatic rescission clause
and by sending letters advising JWD of the balances due, thus
looking forward to receiving payments on it. Moreover, when
JWD made arrangement for the acquisition of additional 870
square meters, HB, Inc. could not have delivered the entire
area contracted for, so neither could the buyer (JWD) be liable
in default.

HELD: The trial court is correct. There is here a clear
waiver of the stipulated right of “automatic rescission,” as
evidenced by the many extensions granted the buyer by the
seller.
Art. 1383. The action for rescission is subsidiary; it cannot
be instituted except when the party suffering damage has no
other legal means to obtain reparation for the same.
.

,

(1) Rescission Not a Principal Remedy

Rescission is not a principal remedy; it is only subsidiary
and may only be availed of by the injured party if it has no other
legal means of seeking redress or reparation for the damages
caused. If, therefore, it is found out that the debtor has no other
property than that which is the object of the rescindable contract,
rescission may merely be applied, provided that all the essential
770

Art. 1383

requisites for rescission are present. (Regalado v. Luchsinger &
Co., 5 Phil. 625)

P47.000 payable in installments. On many occasions, HB, Inc.

COMMENT:

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

In one case, the Supreme Court held that when a creditor
seeks to set aside a contract as fraudulent, he must prove first
that he really is a creditor, and secondly, that he cannot collect
his debt in any other way. (Kuenzle & Streiff v. Watson & Co.,
13 Phil. 26)
(2) Cases

Panlilio v. Victoria
35 Phil. 706

FACTS: When the owner of a drug store began to realize
that as a result of a judgment against him, his drug store would
be sold to pay his creditors, the owner connived with a friend by
selling to the latter for a small sum the drug store. The creditors
were not in any way able to recover from the owner, so they
asked for the rescission of said sale of the drug store.
ISSUE: Will rescission prosper?
HELD: Yes, the rescission will prosper because this is the
only way the creditors can obtain the satisfaction of their credits.
Contreras and Gingco v. China Ranking Corp.
76 Phil. 709

FACTS: A and B, a creditor of the former because of certain
debts, were declared by the court to be the co-owners of a certain
real property. The case was appealed. Pending judgment, A
mortgaged the whole property to a Bank to get some money.
Later, the decision regarding co-ownership was affirmed.
ISSUE: May B, who has vainly exhausted other means,
now ask for the rescission of the mortgage?

HELD: That part of the mortgage referring to the half share
of B need not be rescinded since it is already void, considering
the fact that A had no right to make the mortgage.
That part of the mortgage referring to the half share of A
may be rescinded because it was done in fraud of him, and there
is no other way to collect his credit.

Arts. 1384-1385

Art. 1384. Rescission shall be only to the extent necessary
to cover the damages caused.

COMMENT:

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(2) Requisites before the Action for Rescission Can Be

Brought

(a)

Generally, the plaintiff must be able to RETURN what
has been received by virtue of the rescissible contract.
(Exception: prejudiced creditors.)

(b)

The thing object of the contract is not in the legal possession
of third persons in good faith.

(1) Partial Rescission

This is a new provision of the new Civil Code, making
possible partial rescission, since after all, the only purpose of
rescission is to repair or cover the damages caused. Complete
rescission will not therefore be allowed, if it is not justified by
the circumstances of the case. Insofar as it is not rescinded, the
alienation is valid.

[NOTE: Example of legal possession: registration in
the Registry of Property.]
[NOTE: In order that the property be not taken away
from a third person, said person must not only be in legal
possession; he must also be in good faith. Good faith alone,
however, without legal possession is not sufficient.]

(2) Person Benefited

Only the creditor who has asked for rescission, not the
other creditors, benefits from the rescission.

Art. 1385. Rescission creates the obligation to return the
things which were the object of the contract, together with
their fruits, and the price with its interest; consequently, it
can be carried out only when he who demands rescission can
return whatever he may be obliged to restore.

Neither shall rescission take place when the things which
are the object of the contract are legally in the possession of
third persons who did not act in bad faith.

In this case, indemnity for damages may be demanded
from the person causing the loss.
COMMENT:
(1) Necessity of Mutual Restitution

(c)

There must be no other legal remedy. (Art. 1383, Civil Code
and Kuenzle & Streiffv. Watson and Co., 16 Phil. 26)

(d)

The action must be brought within the proper prescriptive
period. (See Art. 1389, Civil Code)

(3) Illustrative Questions

(a)

ANS.: No, the fruits received need not be given to A

because the right takes place only when “delivery of the
thing sold has been made.” (Hodges v. Granada, 59 Phil.
429)

(c)

772

What should be returned in rescinding a contract?

ANS.:
1) The object of the contract, with its fruits, must be
returned.
2) The price, with its interest, must be returned.
(b) A bought real property from B. A brought action to
rescind the contract on the ground of non-delivery of the
property. Does B have to give also the fruits received in
the meantime?

The obligation of restitution does not obviously apply
to creditors who seek to impugn fraudulent transactions of
their debtors. (TS, March 26, 1923) The obligation of mutual
restitution applies to OTHERS so that the status quo may be
restored.

Art. 1386

A sold to B a piece of land in fraud of his (A’s) creditors. B
took legal possession. If no other means are found to exact
773

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1386

the satisfaction of the credits owing the creditors, may the
sale to B be rescinded?
ANS.: It depends upon whether B was in good faith
or in bad faith.
1)
If B was in good faith, rescission cannot take place,
because the object of the contract is legally in the
possession of a third person who did not act in bad
faith.
2)
If B was in bad faith, rescission is proper.
(d) To defraud his creditors A sold to B a piece of land. B
is an innocent purchaser in good faith, who takes legal
possession of the land. Since the creditors cannot rescind
the contract, what is their remedy?
ANS.: Their remedy in this case would be to demand
indemnity for damages from the person causing the loss.
(Last sentence, Art. 1385, Civil Code)
(e)

(f)

To really protect himself against rescission, what should
an innocent third party, who in good faith purchases real
property, do after having acquired the property?
ANS.: He must register the realty purchased in the
registration office. ( Cordovero and Aleazar v. Villaruz and
Borromeo, 46 Phil. 473)
To defraud his creditor, A sold his property to B (who is in
good faith). Later B sold the property to C, who is in bad
faith. May the creditor rescind, although the property is
now in the possession of C?
ANS.: No, for it does not matter whether C is in good
or bad faith, since he obtained the same from B who is in
good faith. It is B’s good faith that is important.

Art. 1386. Rescission referred to in Nos. 1 and 2 of Article
1381 shall not take place with respect to contracts approved
by the courts.

COMMENT:
Effect If Contracts Were Judicially Approved

See comments under No. (1) of Art. 1381.
774

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1387

Art. 1387. All contracts by virtue of which the debtor
alienates property by gratuitous title are presumed to have
been entered into in fraud of creditors, when the donor did
not reserve sufficient property to pay all debts contracted
before the donation.

Alienations by onerous title are also presumed fraudulent
when made by persons against whom some judgment has
been rendered in any instance or some writ of attachment
has been issued. The decision or attachment need not refer
to the property alienated, and need not have been obtained
by the party seeking the rescission.
In addition to these presumptions, the design to defraud
creditors may be proved in any other manner recognized by
the law of evidence.

COMMENT:
(1) Presumptions of Fraud

This Article establishes presumptions of fraud in the case

of:
(a)

gratuitous alienations;

(b)

onerous alienations.

(2) Gratuitous Alienations

—

(a)

Presumed fraudulent when the debtor did not reserve
sufficient property to pay all debts contracted BEFORE
the donation.

(b)

Example:

A donated his land to B. Before the time he made
the donation, he had several debts, but he did not reserve
enough property to pay all these debts. Instead, he made
the donation. Is the donation presumed fraudulent.

ANS.: Yes, the donation is presumed in fraud of
creditors. But, of course, this presumption may be rebutted
by adequate proof.

Problem:

debts. What A has left as assets are much less than his

was about seven months after the judgment had been
rendered. However, the sale was made in 1933 and,
therefore, fell under the old Civil Code which authorized in
Art. 1413 thereof a husband as administrator of the
copjugal partnership to alienate by onerous title conjugal
property even without the wife’s consent.
ISSUE: Is the sale valid?

ANS.: No, because the debts here of A were incurred
after the donation had been made. As a matter of fact,
the presumption of fraud does not even arise in this case.
However, under the doctrine of “anticipatory fraud,”
rescission may still prosper if it can be shown that the
donation had been deliberately made beforehand to avoid
the payment of debts still to be contracted.
(3) Onerous Alienations
(a)

(b)

Art. 1387

Presumed fraudulent

—

when made by persons:

1)

against whom some judgment has been rendered in
any instance (thus, even if not yet a final judgment);

2)

or against whom some writ of attachment has been
issued. (Art. 1387, Civil Code)

Example:
After a judgment had been rendered against him, A
sold his property to B. Is the sale presumed fraudulent?

ANS.: Yes, the sale here is presumed fraudulent
because it was made after a judgment had been issued
against A. (See Gaston v. Hernaez, 58 Phil. 823) Upon
the other hand, if the sale had been made BEFORE the
judgment, the presumption of fraud cannot apply. This
is so even if, unknown to the buyer, the suit had already
been brought, but STILL PENDING as long as of course
no attachment had been issued. (Adolfo Gaspar v. Leopoldo
Dorado, et al., L 17884, Nov. 29, 1965)
Isidore L. Cabaliw and Soledad Sadorra v.
Sotero Sadorra, et al.
L-25650, June 11, 1975

FACTS: After a judgment for support was rendered
against a husband and in favor of his wife, the husband
776

(c)

(d)

HELD: The sale should be invalidated because it is
presumed to have been made in fraud of the judgment
creditor who happens to be the wife, the sale having been
made to avoid payment of the judgment debt for support.
The presumption of a fraudulent transaction established
by specific provision of law (Art. 1387, New Civil Code;
Art. 1297, old Civil Code) cannot be overcome by the mere
fact that the deed of sale in question is in the nature of a
public instrument. The principle that strong and convincing
evidence is necessary to overthrow an existing public
document does not apply to third persons (who might be
adversely prejudiced) but only to the parties to a contract.
Close relationship between the vendor and the vendee is
one of the known badges of fraud. The burden of rebutting
the presumption of fraud established by law rests on the
transferee who claims otherwise. Article 1413 of the old
Civil Code does not apply because here the aggrieved party
was prejudiced as a judgment creditor, but even were it to
apply, still a prejudiced wife may seek redress in court.
The decision or attachment need not refer to the property
alienated, and need not have been obtained by the party
seeking the rescission. (Art. 1387, Civil Code)
Example:
A brought an action against B, his debtor. A won. After
judgment, B sold his property to C. X, another creditor of
B, wants to rescind this sale to C. Both C and B claim that
X does not have the right to interfere because, after all, it
was A, not X, who had won a judgment against B. Are C
and B justified?
777

Art. 1387

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ANS.: No, C and B are not justified. It is true that it
was A, notX, who won the judgment, but this is immaterial
since the law says that the decision need not have been
obtained by the party seeking the rescission. (2nd sentence,
second par.. Art. 1387, Civil Code)
(e)

Another example:

In a case, A’s house at 11 Leveriza Street was attached
by the court. A sold his house at 22 San Miguel Street to
B, after the attachment on the first house had been made.
C, a creditor of A, now says that the sale is presumed
fraudulent. A counters by saying that there is no such
presumption because after all the house which had been
attached was not the one sold to B. Is A justified?
ANS.: No, A is not justified. It is true that the house
he sold had not been levied upon or attached, but the
fact remains that A is a person against whom some writ
of attachment has been issued. The law says that the
attachment need not refer to the property alienated. (2nd
sentence, 2nd par., Art. 1387, Civil Code)

De Jesus v. G. Urrutia and Co.
33 Phil. 171

FACTS: A has two parcels of land. The first was
mortgaged to B. During the mortgage, A sold the second
parcel to C. When the mortgage debt fell due, A could not
pay; hence, the mortgage was foreclosed. Since the land
was sold in the foreclosure proceedings for an amount less
than the value of the debt, B was given the right to get the
balance from A. But A had no more money. B now seeks to
rescind the sale to C of the second parcel of land, alleging
the sale was done to defraud him.
ISSUE: Is the sale to C presumed fraudulent?
HELD: No, the sale to C is not presumed fraudulent. It
is true that the sale was made after the mortgage of the first
parcel of land, but we cannot apply the first presumption in

the pertinent article of the Civil Code, because the contract
was not gratuitous. The second presumption (about onerous
contracts) cannot be also applied because in this case, the
778

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1387

sale had been made prior to the judgment against A, the
judgment debtor.
(4) Badges of Fraud

There are some circumstances indicating that a certain
alienation has been made in fraud of creditors. These are called
BADGES OF FRAUD.
Oria v. McMicking
21 Phil. 243

FACTS: To defraud his creditors, a father sold a certain
real property to his son for a very small sum. The property,
although apparently sold, was nevertheless still occupied by the
father. The transfer was made after suit by the creditors had
been instituted against the father. It was also proved that the
father had no other property.
ISSUE: May the contract be rescinded?
HELD: Yes, the contract may be rescinded as being in
fraud of creditors. The Supreme Court made the following
observations:
“In determining whether or not a certain conveyance is
fraudulent, the question in every case is whether conveyance
was a bona fide transaction or a trick and contrivance to defeat
creditors, or whether it conserves to the debtor a special right.
It is not sufficient that it is founded on good consideration, or
is made with bona fide intent; it must have both elements. If
defective in either of these particulars, although good between
the parties, it is rescissible as to creditors. The rule is universal
both in law and in equity that whatever fraud creates, justice will
destroy. The test as to whether or not a conveyance is fraudulent
is: Does it prejudice the rights of creditors?
“In the consideration of whether or not certain transfers
were fraudulent, courts have laid down certain rules by which
the fraudulent character of the transaction may be determined.
The following are some of the circumstances attending sales
which have been denominated by the courts as badges of fraud:
1) The fact that the consideration of the conveyance is
fictitious or inadequate;
779

Art. 1387

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
2)

A transfer made by a debtor after suit has been begun
and while it is pending against him;

3)

A sale upon credit by an insolvent debtor;

4)

The transfer of all or nearly all of his property by
a debtor, especially when he is insolvent or greatly
embarrassed financially;

5)

Evidence of large indebtedness or complete insolvency;

6)

The fact that the transfer is made between father
and son ( when this fact is considered together with
preceding circumstances);

7)

The failure of the vendee to take exclusive possession
of all the property.

“The case at bar presents everyone of the badges of fraud
above enumerated. Tested by the inquiry, does the sale prejudice
the rights of creditor? The result is clear. The sale in the form it
was made leaves the creditors substantially without recourse.
The property of the company is gone, the business itself is likely
to fail, the property is being dissipated and is depreciating in
value. As a result, even if the claims of the creditors should live
twelve years, and the creditors themselves wait that long, it is
more than likely that nothing would be found to satisfy their
claims at the end of the long wait.” (Regalado v. Luchsinger &
Co., 5 Phil. 625; and Manresa’s Commentaries, Vol. 8, pp. 713719)

Alpuerto v. Perez Pastor and Roa
38 Phil. 785

FACTS: Pending the termination of a court litigation
with him as defendant, a person secretly sold to his son-in-law
substantially all his property for less than half the value of
said properties. Later, when the case was decided the plaintiff¬
creditor could not recover anything from the defendant.
Hence, he brought an action for the rescission of the sale. The
defense stated that the transaction had been made prior to the
promulgation of the decision, and that therefore there can be
no presumption of “fraud of creditors.”

ISSUE: May the sale be rescinded?
780

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1387

HELD: Yes, the sale may be rescinded. Aside from
the presumptions given by the Code regarding fraudulent
conveyances, the designs to defraud creditors may be proved, as
it has been proved in this case, in any other manner recognized
by the law of evidence. Said the Supreme Court:
“The purchaser did not satisfactorily prove that he was
a purchaser in good faith. The secrecy of the purported sale
and the relation of kinship existing between the parties are
circumstances indicative of collusion.”
[NOTE: Relationship alone does not by itself constitute
a badge of fraud. (Smo. Nombre de Jesus u. Sanchez, (CA.) 40
O.G. 1685)]

[NOTE: If there is great disparity between the price and
the real value of the property, this is an indication of badges of
fraud. (Asia Bank v. Noble Jose, 51 Phil. 736)]
(5) Rule in Case of Registered Lands

Abaya v. Enriquez, et al.
L-8988, May 17, 1957

(Illustrating the principle that the presumption of fraud
established in Art. 1387 does not apply to registered lands under
the Torrens System IF the judgment or attachment made is not
also registered.)

FACTS: Enriquez owed Abaya a sum of money evidenced
by a promissory note. Abaya obtained a judgment, and part
payment was made by Enriquez, leaving the judgment partially
unsatisfied. Subsequently, Enriquez sold two registered parcels
of land to the spouses Artemio and Nera Jongco, complete
strangers to them. The judgment in favor of Abaya and the
writ of execution issued were never annotated at the back of
the Transfer Certificate of Title to the land. Abaya assailed the
validity of the alienation on the ground that same has been made
in fraud of his rights, the transaction having been effected after
a judgment and an attachment had been issued. Thus, he sued
for the rescission of the sale.
HELD: The rescission will not prosper, for the presumption
established in Art. 1387 does not apply in this case for two
781

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1387

reasons: firstly, the spouses Jongco had no complicity at all in
the fraud imputed to Enriquez; secondly, the encumbrance of
the judgment and the attachment, not having been registered
and annotated on the certificate, cannot prejudice an innocent
purchaser for value of registered land. The Civil Code must yield
to the Mortgage and to the Registration Laws, which are special

laws.
(6) Valid Before Rescission

Borja v. Addison
44 Phil. 895

FACTS: To defraud his creditors, A sold real property

to B.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1388

(9) Fraud Alone Not Sufficient for Rescission

QUESTION: Just because a contract is made to defraud
creditors, does this necessarily mean that it can be rescinded?

ANS.: No, for after all the transferee may have been in
good faith and is now in legal possession of the property. (See
Art. 1385, 2nd par., Civil Code)
Art. 1388. Whoever acquires in bad faith the things
alienated in fraud of creditors, shall indemnify the latter
for damages suffered by them on account of the alienation,
whenever, due to any cause, it should be impossible for him
to return them.

If there are two or more alienations, the first acquirer
shall be liable first, and so on successively.

ISSUE: Before the sale is rescinded, is it valid?
HELD: Yes, it is valid. Sales of real property for the purpose
of defeating or frustrating judgment creditors are not valid. Until
they are rescinded, they are legally effective and can convey title.
(7) Necessity of a Direct Action for Rescission

To defraud his creditors, A sold real property to B. B now
seeks to register the land. X, a creditor, seeks to prevent the
registration on the ground that the transaction is rescindable.
Despite X’s objection, may the land be registered in B’s name?
ANS.: Yes. X should have brought first the action for
rescission. Before a sale is rescinded, it is valid, and its validity
cannot be attacked collaterally (in a proceeding different from an
action to rescind) in a proceeding like land registration. (Borja
v. Addison, 44 Phil. 895)

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Bad Faith
(a)

(b)
(c)

To defraud his creditors, X sold his house to Y, who
knew of X’s purpose. If the sale is rescinded, Y must
indemnify, even if the house be destroyed by a fortuitous
event, but only if X himself cannot pay. (Remember that
rescission is merely a secondary remedy available only
when X cannot pay.)
(2) Subsequent Transfers
(a)

If the first transferee is in good faith, the good or bad faith
of the next transferee is not important.

(b)

If the first transferee is in bad faith, the next transferee is
liable only if he is also in bad faith.

(c)

Example:

(8) Presumption of Validity

A gratuitous conveyance or donation validly executed is,
on its face (prima facie), presumed valid and good as between
the parties. It cannot be declared fraudulent and, therefore,
subject to rescission unless it can be shown that at the time of
the execution of the conveyance, there was a creditor or creditors
whom said transaction may affect adversely. (Solis v. Chua Pua
Hnos., et al., 50 Phil. 636)
782

The acquirer must return or indemnify.
“Due to any cause” includes a fortuitous event.
Example:

A, in fraud of creditors, sold his house to B, who is in
bad faith. B in turn alienated it in favor of C, who later sold
it to D. Both C and D were also in bad faith. The contract
783

Art. 1388

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

is rescinded but the house is destroyed. Who, if any, are
liable for damages?

ANS.: B is liable first. If he cannot pay, then C will
be liable. If C cannot pay, D will be liable. The law says
that “if there are two or more alienations, the first acquirer
shall be liable first, and so on successively." (2nd par., Art.
1388, Civil Code)
(3) Concept of ‘Bad Faith’

“Bad Faith" has been defined as a state of mind affirmatively
operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest
or ill-will or for an ulterior purpose, and implies a conscious and

intentional design to do a wrongful act for a dishonest purpose
or moral obliquity. (See Republic v. Desierto, 481 SCRA 153
[2006]; and Gatmaitan v. Gonzales, 492 SCRA 591 [2006])

Nonchalance in performing an urgent obligation indicates
gross negligence amounting to bad faith. (Radio Communications
of the Phils., Inc. v. Verchez, 481 SCRA 384 [2006]) Nonetheless,
in ascertaining the intention of the persons accused of acting in
bad faith, courts must carefully examine the evidence as to the
conduct and outward acts from which the inward motive may
be determined. (Francisco v. Co, 481 SCRA 241 [2006])

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

in the depositor’s signature and photograph, the absence of the
original certificate of time and deposit and the lack of notarized
waiver dormant, constitutes gross negligence amounting to bad
faith under Art. 2220 of the new Civil Code.

Art. 1389. The action to claim rescission must be

commenced within four years.

For persons under guardianship and for absentees, the
period of four years shall not begin until the termination of
the former’s incapacity, or until the domicile of the latter is
known.

Five years after a rescissible contract was made, action
was brought for its rescission. The person who asked for
the rescission was neither a ward nor an absentee at the
time of the transaction of the rescissible contract. Will
rescission still be allowed?
ANS.: No, the rescission will no longer be allowed
because the action has already prescribed. “The action to
claim rescission must be commenced within four years.”

Art. 1389

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

property. How many years will be given the ward to rescind
the contract?

ANS.: The ward will be given four years after reaching
the age of majority (the time the guardianship ceases);
hence, before reaching 22 years of age, the former ward
should already have sued for the rescission of the contract.
(2nd par., Art. 1389, Civil Code)

VOIDABLE CONTRACTS
Art. 1390. The following contracts are voidable or
annullable, even though there may have been no damage to
the contracting parties:
( 1 ) Those where one of the parties is incapable of giving
consent to a contract;

(2) Those where the consent is vitiated by mistake,
violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud.

These contracts are binding, unless they are annulled by
a proper action in court. They are susceptible of ratification.

fication is required.

A contract where consent is vitiated, such as by violence
or intimidation, is not void ab initio but only voidable, and is
binding upon the parties unless annulled by proper action in
court; so, in a case where the plaintiff corporation’s stockholders
sold their entire stocks to a Japanese corporation in 1943, it
cannot recover its former properties which were, after liberation,
turned over to the Republic as enemy-owned properties. A mere
allegation that the sale to the Japanese firm had been perfected
through intimidation will not ipso facto revert to stockholders
of the plaintiff the ownership of the stocks without any judicial
declaration. Indeed, one who desires to recover lands as the
owner from another upon the theory that the deeds held by
the other are null and void, must first ask that such alleged
fraudulent deeds be set aside. (Pio Grande Rubber Estate, Inc.
v. Board of Liquidators, et al., L-11321, Nov. 28, 1958)

Art. 1390

If a house is built with conjugal funds on the husband’s

Lopez v. Jimmy Ong
L-9021, May 31, 1957

FACTS: Ong leased a theater beginning September 1951. In
the lease contract with the owner, Ong agreed to allow a certain
employee named Lopez to continue with his job till December
31, 1951. Lopez subsequently made Ong sign a document which
continued Lopez’s employment till 1956, but which Lopez had
fraudulently told Ong (who did not understand English, the
789

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1391

language of the document) merely continued Lopez’s job till Dec.
31, 1951. On Jan. 31, 1952, Ong dismissed Lopez. Lopez filed an
action for damages on the ground that he had been dismissed
unjustifiably before 1956.

HELD: The contract is voidable because of fraud; therefore,
Ong can validly dismiss Lopez. The fact that dismissal was made
on Jan. 31, 1952 instead of Dec. 31, 1951 cannot by itself be
considered a ratification since the period is too short to warrant
a validation of the contract.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
(1) Historical Notes on Prescriptive Period for Annulment

This is a substantial restatement of Art. 1301 of the old
Civil Code, with the following changes:
(a)

“Undue influence” has been added in the third paragraph.
In the old Civil Code, this was not found.

(b)

In the fourth paragraph, the old Civil Code provision
reads as follows: “In those of error or deceit or falsity
of consideration, from the date of the consummation of
contract.”

(c)

The provision in the old Article which reads “when the
purpose of the action is to invalidate the unauthorized
contracts of a married woman, from the date of the
dissolution of the marriage” has been eliminated because,
as a rule, married women are no longer classed together
with persons not capacitated to give consent.

(5) Selling of Subdivision, Lots, and Condominiums Units

G.G. Sportswear Mfg. Corp.
v. World Class Properties, Inc.
614 SCRA 75
(2010)

FACTS: The law penalizes the selling of subdivision lots
and condominium units without prior issuance of a Certificate
Units without prior issuance of a Certificate of Registration and
License to sell by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board
(HLURB).

ISSUE: Will the absence thereof automatically render a
contract otherwise validly entered void?

HELD: No, because the law does not so provide that the
chance thereof will automatically render a contract otherwise
validly entered void.

Art. 1391. The action for annulment shall be brought
within four years.
This period shall begin:

In cases of intimidation, violence or undue influence,
from the time the defect of the consent ceases.
In case of mistake or fraud, from the time of the discovery
of the same.
And when the action refers to contracts entered into
by minors or other incapacitated persons, from the time the
guardianship ceases.

(2) Effect of Prescription

If the action has prescribed, the contract can no longer be
set aside. (Villanueva v. Villanueva, 91 Phil. 43)
(3) Illustrative Problems

A was intimidated into signing a contract on June 1, 1999.
The intimidation continued until Sept. 1, 2001. From
what time should we compute the four-year period for
annulment?
ANS.: From Sept. 1, 2001, the time the intimidation
ceased.
(b) On June 1, 2005, A entered into a contract with B. On Jan.
4, 2006, A discovered that fraud had been present at the
time he entered into the contract. Such a fraud vitiated
his consent. Within what time must A bring the action for
annulment?

bring action for annulment; otherwise, his right to sue
for said annulment will have prescribed. January 4, 2006

In the case of contracts entered into by minors or

Marcos in approving the sale. On motion of the defendants,
the complaint was dismissed on the ground, inter alia, that
the action had prescribed.

HELD: Under Art. 1391 of the Civil Code, contracts
where consent is given through mistake, violence,
intimidation, undue influence or fraud
are valid until
they are annulled. As the contract in question is merely
voidable, the period within which to annul the same is four
years, counted, in cases of intimidation, violence, or undue
influence, from the time the defect of the contract ceases,
and in case of mistake or fraud, from the time of discovery.

Carantes v. Court of Appeals
L-33360, April 25, 1977

FACTS: Certain co-heirs assigned, in 1939 in favor of
a co-heir, a parcel of land in Loakan, Baguio. The document
was registered in 1940. The assignors sued in 1958 for the
annulment of the assignment, claiming that they thought
they were signing a mere authority to sell, not the sale
itself.

In the case at bench, the prescriptive period to
annul the sale would have begun on Feb. 26, 1986 when
Marcos was deposed. Prescription would have set in by
Feb. 26, 1990 or more than three years before MWSS filed
its complaint. However, if MWSS* consent was vitiated
by fraud, then the prescriptive period commenced upon
discovery. Discovery commenced from the date of execution
of the sale documents as petitioner was party thereto. At
the least, discovery is deemed to have taken place on the
date of registration of the deeds with the Register of Deeds
as registration is constructive notice to the world. Given
these two principles on discovery, the prescriptive period
commenced in 1983 as MWSS actually knew of the sale,
or in 1984 when the agreements were registered and titles
thereafter were issued to STC. At the latest, the action
would have prescribed in 1988, or about five years before
the complaint was instituted.

ISSUE: Has the action prescribed?
HELD: Yes. Considered as a fraudulent contract, the
period allowed for bringing the action is only four years,
counted from registration in 1940 of the deed of assignment;
considered as a constructive trust, the period is ten years.

Metropolitan Waterworks and
Sewerage System v. Court of Appeals
GR 12600 and 128520, Oct. 7, 1998

FACTS: In 1965, the MWSS leased a piece of land
to Capitol Hills Golf Club, Inc. (CHGCI) with a right of
first refusal in case the property is sold. After President
Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Letter of Instruction 440 in
1976, MWSS offered to sell to Capitol Hills the property
at P40.00 per square meter.
The Board of Trustees of MWSS approved the sale
in favor of Silhouette Trading Corp. (STC), as assignee of
CHGCI. The contract was signed in 1983. In 1984, STC
sold part of the property to Ayala Land, Inc. (ALI) which
paid Pl10 per sq. m. In 1993, MWSS filed an action against
ALI, STC, and CHGCI to recover the property alleging
that the MWSS Board of Trustees was unduly influenced by

In the case of Tipton v. Velasco, 6 Phil. 67, the Supreme
Court said that mere lapse of time does not legalize a voidable
contract; but in Fabie v. Yulo, 24 Phil. 240, it was held that
remaining silent for a certain period of time ratifies such a
contract.

Art*. 1395-1396

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:

Art. 1397

(2) Example

(1) Ratification by Guardian
(a)

This Article refers to the ratification of a contract entered
into by the incapacitated person.

(b)

Since the person entitled to ratify is still incapacitated, his
guardian acts in his behalf. (See Escoto v. Arcilla, 89 Phil.

199)

(2) Ratification by the Injured Party Himself

Ratification can be made by the injured party himself,
provided he is capacitated, or has become capacitated.
(3) Distinguished from Action to Rescind

Article 1394 does not refer to a rescissible contract entered
into by the guardian in behalf of his ward.
Art. 1395. Ratification does not require the conformity
of the contracting party who has no right to bring the action
for annulment.

COMMENT:
Conformity of Guilty Party Not Needed

Reason: The guilty party’s consent is not needed; otherwise,
he may find a way of getting out of the contract by the simple
expedient of refusing to ratify.
Art. 1396. Ratification cleanses the contract from all its
defects from the moment it was constituted.

COMMENT:
(1) Retroactive Effect of Ratification
(a) Note the retroactive effect; thus, once ratification has taken
place, annulment based on the original defects cannot
prosper. (Tan Ah Chan v. Gonzales, 52 Phil. 180)
(b)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Although there is a retroactive effect, the rights of innocent
third persons must not be prejudiced.
796

A minor sold his land to X. When he became 22 years old,
he became indebted to Y. To avoid paying Y, the former minor
decided to ratify the sale of the land. He then had no other
property. May Y still rescind the sale although at the time it
was made he was not yet a creditor?

ANS.: Yes. Although ratification has a retroactive
effect, still his rights as an innocent third person must not be
prejudiced.
Art. 1397. The action for the annulment of contracts may
be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or
subsidiarily. However, persons who are capable cannot allege
the incapacity of those with whom they contracted; nor can
those who exerted intimidation, violence, or undue influence,
or employed fraud, or caused mistake base their action upon
these flaws of the contract.

COMMENT:
(1) Persons Who May Ask for Annulment
The victim (principal or subsidiary party) may ask for
annulment, not the guilty person or his successor. Reason: He
who comes to equity must come with clean hands. (Bastida v.
Dy Buncio and Co., 93 Phil. 195)

Mendoza v. De Guzman
(CA.) 39 O.G. May 27, 1941, p. 1505

FACTS: A minor contracted with X. Xs heir, Y, sues for
annulment on the ground that the other party was a minor.

HELD: Annulment cannot prosper, for just as X has no
right to sue, being the capacitated party, so also Y, who merely
derives any right he has from his predecessor-in-interest, X.
Development Bank v. Court of Appeals
L-28774, Feb. 28, 1980

The general rule is that the action for the annulment
of contracts can only be maintained by those who are bound
either principally or subsidiarily by virtue thereof. (Art. 1397,
797

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1397

Civil Code) There is, however, an exception to the rule: A person
who is not obliged principally or subsidiarily in a contract may
exercise an action for nullity of the contract if he is prejudiced in
his rights with respect to one of the contracting parties, and can
show the detriment which could positively result to him from the
contract in which he had no intervention. (Teves v. People’s HHC,
L-21498, June 27, 1968; De Santos v. City of Manila, L-21677,
June 29, 1972; and Banez v. Court of Appeals, L-30351, Sept.
11, 1974)
Development Bank of the Philippines v.
Court of Appeals
L-28774, Feb. 28, 1980

A person not obliged principally or subsidiarily in a contract
may nevertheless ask for its annulment if he is prejudiced in his
rights regarding one of the contracting parties. (See also Banez
v. Court of Appeals, L-30351, Sept. 11, 1974)

CFI of Rizal and Elena Ong Escutin v.
Court of Appeals and Felix Ong
July 25, 1981

A private sale authorized by a probate court (and without
objection on the part of the heirs or creditors) cannot be assailed
by a person who is not an “interested party” (such as an heir
or creditor). One who merely offered a higher price (without
actually buying the property) is not “an interested party.” It
would have been different had there been a public auction.

Earth Minerals Exploration v. Deputy
Executive Sec. Catalino Macaraig, Jr.
GR 78569, Feb. 11, 1991
FACTS: Zambales Chromite is the exclusive owner of ten
patentable chromite mining claims. Zambales Chromite as
claim owner, on one hand, and Philzea Mining as operator, on
the other, entered into a “contract of development, exploitation
and productive operation on the mining claims.” During the
lifetime of such contract, Earth Minerals submitted a letter of
intent to Zambales Chromite, whereby the former proposed, and
the latter agreed, to operate the same mining area subject of
the earlier agreement between Zambales Chromite and Philzea
798

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1397

Mining. Consequently, the same mining property of Zambales
became the subject of different agreement with two separate and
distinct operators. Earth Minerals filed with the Bureau of Mines
a petition for cancellation of the contract between Zambales
Chromite and Philzea Mining, pursuant to Sec. 7, PD 1281.
Earth Minerals alleged that Philzea committed grave violations
of the latter’s contract with Zambales Chromite, among which
are: failure to produce the agreed volume of chromite ores; failure
to pay ad valorem taxes; failure to put up assay buildings and
offices, all resultingin the non-productivity and non-development
of the mining area. Philzea moved to dismiss on the grounds
that Earth Minerals is not the proper party in interest and that
the petition lacks a cause of action. The Bureau of Mines denied
the motion holding that “there appears some color of right” on
Earth Minerals to initiate the petition for cancellation. Philzea
elevated the case to the Ministry of Natural Resources which
dismissed the appeal for the reason that the Bureau’s order was
an interlocutory order that could not be the proper subject of an
appeal. Philzea appealed to the office of the President. During
the pendency thereof. Earth Minerals filed with the MNR a
motion for execution of the Ministry of Natural Resources’
(MNR) order dismissing Philzea’s appeal. The MNR directed
the Bureau of Mines to conduct the necessary investigation to
hasten the development of the mining claims. In compliance
therewith, the Bureau of Mines ordered Philzea to file its answer
to Earth Minerals’ petition for rescission. Philzea did not submit
its answer. So, the Bureau of Mines resolved the petition based
on the documents submitted by Earth Minerals. Finding that
Philzea violated the terms and conditions of the mining contract
between Philzea and Zambales, the Bureau of Mines cancelled
said mining contracts. The Office of the President set aside the
decision of the Minister of Natural Resources and the Bureau
of Mines. As to whether Earth Minerals is the proper party to
seek cancellation of the operating agreement between Philzea
Mining and Zambales Chromite, the Executive Secretary argues
that Earth Minerals is not the proper party to file the petition
for cancellation of the contract between Zambales Chromite
and Philzea Mineral, citing Art. 1311 of the Civil Code which
provides that a contract takes effect only between the parties,
their assigns and heirs.
799

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1397

HELD: Setting aside the decision of the Executive Secretary
the orders of the Bureau of Mines and the
reinstating
and
Minister of Natural Resources, the Supreme Court held that the
contention is untenable. Earth Minerals seeks the cancellation
of the contract between Zambales Chromite and Philzea Mining,
not as a party to the contract but because its rights are prejudiced
by said contract. The prejudice and detriment to the rights and
interest of Earth Minerals stem from the continued existence
of the contract between Zambales Chromite and Philzea.
Unless and until the contract between Zambales Chromite and
Philzea Mining is cancelled, Earth Minerals’ contract with the
former involving the same mining area cannot be in effect and
it cannot perform its own obligations and derive benefits under
the contract. Moreover, the decision of the Director of Mines as
affirmed by the Minister of Natural Resources was supported
by substantial evidence. The violations committed by Philzea
Mining were not only violations of its operating agreement with
Zambales Chromite but of mining laws as well.
Problem: Rodel, 17, contracted in 2012 with Patrick, 60,
a guitar store owner, to supply the latter with guitar strings.
May Patrick annul the contract on the ground that Rodel was
incapable of giving consent to a contract? Explain.
Answer: No, under the law on contracts, specifically Art.
1397 of the Civil Code, only the incapacitated person can bring
the action to annul, based on the ground of estoppel. Hence, only
Rodel may bring the action to annul.
(2) Creditors of the Victim

The creditors of the victim cannot ask for annulment for
they are not bound by the contract.

Illustrative Problem:
A was forced by B to sign a contract. C, a creditor of A,
wants to annul the contract. Is C allowed to do so?
ANS.: No, C is not allowed to do so. If the contract
prejudices him, and A has no other property, then C may ask
for the rescission of the contract, not its annulment. C cannot
ask for annulment because he is not obliged by the terms of said
contract, either principally or subsidiarily.
800

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1398

Problem: A minor forces X to sign a contract. May the minor
later on ask for annulment?
ANS.: No, because he himself is at fault.
(3) Intimidation or Fraud by a Minor

If a minor misrepresents his age and the other party is
misled as to his age, may the minor later on sue for annulment?
(a)

No, because of estoppel. (Mercado v. Espiritu, 37 Phil. 37)

Later on, the Supreme Court had a different view and
answered YES, because according to it, a minor can never
be guilty of estoppel since he is not liable for his conduct
or act. (Young v. Tecson, 39 O.G. 953)
(c) Still later on, the Court again changed its
mind and
answered NO, reiterating the Mercado case. (Sia Suan
and Chao v. Alcantara, GR L-l 720, March 4, 1950, 47 O.G.
4561, where the minor, nearly 20 years old, appeared to be
very clever.)
(b)

Art. 1398. An obligation having been annulled, the
contracting parties shall restore to each other the things
which have been the subject matter of the contract, with their
fruits, and the price with its interest, except in cases provided
by law.

In obligations to render service, the value thereof shall
be the basis for damages.

COMMENT:

Mun. of Cavite v. Rojas
30 Phil. 602

FACTS: A leased a parcel of land from the Municipality
of Cavite. Later the lease was annulled.

(b)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ISSUE: What should each of the parties do now?
HELD: “The defendant must restore and deliver
possession of the land described in the complaint to the
Municipality of Cavite, which in turn must restore to the
said defendant all the sums it may have received from her
in the nature of rentals just as soon as she restores the land
improperly leased.”
If a sale of land is annulled, the seller must return the
purchase price with legal interest and the buyer must
return the land with its fruits. (Labrador v. De los Santos,
66 Phil. 579; and Dumasug v. Modelo, 34 Phil. 252)
However, in the case of Laperal v. Rogers, L-16590, Jan.
30, 1965, the Supreme Court held that the buyer of a
parcel of land does not have to pay rent, during the time
he is in possession (even if the sale is eventually cancelled)
for the simple reason that the seller was himself already
enjoying the use of the money, delivered to such seller,
as the purchase price. The Court further held that in the
absence of a showing that there is considerable disparity
in the benefits derived by both parties, equity will presume
that they are, more or less, the same.
Tan Queto v. Court of Appeals
GR 35648, May 16, 1983
If a husband barters away his wife’s paraphernal
property, the barter has “no effect,” if his wife did not
consent to the transaction. The person who acquires the
land knowing that the same is owned by the wife and
constructs a building thereon may be regarded as a builder
in bad faith. He can, therefore, recover no reimbursement
for such construction. (Art. 449, Civil Code)
802

Article 1398 cannot be availed of by strangers to the
contract. (Gov't, v. Wagner, 5 Phil. 132) Innocent third parties
cannot be obliged to restore. (Dia v. Finance & Mining,
Inc.,

Corp., [CA.] 46 O.G. 127)

(4) Effect of Registration of the Land

Even if the land has already been registered, Art. 1398 still
applies, provided there has been no estoppel. (Tinsay v. Yusay
and Yusay, 47 Phil. 639)
(5) Extra Liability of the Guilty Party

A guilty party who, for example, used force can be held
liable for damages under Arts. 20 and 21 of the Civil Code:
“Art. 20. Every person who, contrary to law, willfully,
or negligently causes damage to another, shall
indemnify the latter for the same.
Art. 21. Any person who willfully causes loss or injury
to another in a manner that is contrary to morals,
good customs or public policy shall compensate the
latter for the damage.”
(6) Personal Obligations

Here the value of the service shall be the basis for damages.

(Art. 1398, 2nd par.)

Art. 1399. When the defect of the contract consists in the
incapacity of one of the parties, the incapacitated person is
not obliged to make any restitution except insofar as he has
been benefited by the thing or price received by him.

COMMENT:
(1) Generally, No Restitution by Incapacitated Party
(a)

The Article applies only if the defect is INCAPACITY.
This constitutes an exception to the obligation of mutual
restitution under Art. 1398.
(c) Here in Art. 1399, restitution is only to the extent of
enrichment (pecuniary or otherwise).
(b)

803

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1399

(2) No Presumption of Enrichment

The law does not presume this enrichment or benefit;
therefore, the capacitated person has the burden of showing
such enrichment. Just because the property had been delivered,
it does not necessarily follow that there was enrichment. (TS,
Oct. 22, 1984)
Of course, if the incapacitated person still has the property,
by
this itself is a benefit which he must return and not squander,
otherwise, this will amount to a ratification. (Uy Soo Lim v. Tan
Unchuan, 38 Phil. 552)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1400

delivers a fungible thing in fulfillment of the obligation (natural
obligation), there shall be no right to recover the same from the
obligee who has spent or consumed it in good faith."
Art. 1400. Whenever the person obliged by the decree of
annulment to return the thing cannot do so because it has
been lost through his fault, he shall return the fruits received
and the value of the thing at the time of the loss, with interest
from the same date.

COMMENT:
(1) Value May Be Substituted for Thing Itself

(3) Case

Uy Soo Lim v. Tan Unchuan
38 Phil. 552

FACTS: A, a minor, entered into a contract with a person
sui juris. After reaching majority he squandered the money
received.
ISSUE: Why is this an implied ratification?
HELD: “The privilege granted minors in disaffirming their
contracts upon reaching the age of majority is subject to prompt
election on the matter. . . The exception of infants from liability
on their contracts proceeds solely upon the principle that such
exemption is essential to their protection, and the law of infancy
should be so administered that the result may be secured. But
it has not infrequently happened that courts, in their anxiety
to protect the rights of infants in the matter of contracts made
by them during non-age, have, after they have become adults,
treated them to the same extent as infants still, exempting them
from the operation of the rules of law. The strong tendency of the
modem decision, however, is to limit the exemptions of infancy,
to the principle upon which the disability proceeds.”
(4) The Capacitated Person Must Restore Whether He

Benefited or Not, Except If Art. 1427 of the Civil Code
Applies
Article 1427 reads: “When a minor between 18 and 21
years of age who has entered into a contract without the consent
of the parent or guardian voluntarily pays a sum of money or

In the duty of mutual restitution, the value of the thing
with interest substitutes for the thing itself that was lost through
the party’s fault.
(2) Example

A forced B to sell him (A) the house of B. B brought an action
to annul the contract. The contract was annulled on the ground
of fraud. A was asked by the court to return to B whatever he
(A) has received. But the house had been destroyed through the
fault of A. What should A now give?
ANS.: A should give all of the following:
(a)

the fruits or rentals of the house received from the time
the house was given to him to the time of its loss;

(b)

the value of the house at the time of the loss;
interest at 6% per annum on the value of the house from
the time the house was destroyed.

(c)

(3) Case

Dumasug v. Modelo
34 Phil. 252

FACTS: A contract between A and B was annulled by the
court. But the object of the contract, a carabao, had died while
in B’s possession.
ISSUE: What should B return?
805

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1401

HELD: “With respect to the plow carabao that died while
in defendant’s possession, the value of which is P120, defendant
is obliged pursuant to the provision of Art. 1307 (now Art. 1400
of the new Civil Code) to pay and deliver to plaintiff the value
of said animal, with interest as an indemnity for the detriment
caused to its owner.”
Art. 1401. The action for annulment of contracts shall bo
extinguished when the thing which is the object thereof is
lost through the fraud or fault of the person who has a right
to institute the proceedings.
If the right of action is based upon the incapacity of any
one of the contracting parties, the loss of the thing shall not
be an obstacle to the success of the action, unless said loss
took place through the fraud or fault of the plaintiff.

COMMENT:
(1) Historical Notes on Effect of Loss of Object through

Fraud or Fault of the Victim
(a) This is a substantial restatement of Art. 1314 of the old
Civil Code, except that the phrase “after having acquired
capacity” after the word “plaintiff” in the second paragraph
has been omitted, implying that under the new Civil Code,
fraud or fault on the part of the aggrieved party may exist
even during his minority. Whereas Art. 1401 of the new
Civil Code refers to fraud or fault on the part of the person
who can bring the action for annulment, Art. 1400 of the
new Civil Code refers to the fault on the part of the person
who cannot bring the action to have the contract declared
annulled.
(b) As things now stand, the two paragraphs in Art. 1401 mean
the same thing.
(2) Query on Squandering by Insane Person

An insane person sold his house, and squandered the
proceeds while insane. Can he ask for annulment later on and
recover the house?
806

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1402

ANS.: Under the second paragraph of Art. 1401, he

cannot sue for annulment and recover the house because the
proceeds were squandered away by him. Thus, according to the
members of the Code Commission, the action cannot prosper,
even if at the time of loss, the plaintiff was still insane or a
minor. (Memorandum to the Joint Congressional Committee on
Codification, March 8, 1951)

AND YET, this would contradict Art. 1399, because there,
the incapacitated person is not obliged to make any restitution
except insofar as he has been benefited by the thing or price
received by him. Being insane, he could not have profited by
squandering the money.

It is thus believed that the answer of the Code Commission
is NOT accurate for even were we to apply Art. 1401 (2nd
paragraph), it is clear that the loss during the insanity could
not be due to “fraud” or “fault.”
(3) Problems
(a)

A was forced to sign a contract with B. In said contract, A

was given a house. But A destroyed the house. May A still
bring the action for annulment?
ANS.: No more. His act of destroying the house
extinguished his right to bring the action for annulment.
(b) A, a minor, was sold a house by B. The house was destroyed
by a fortuitous event. May A still annul the contract so as
to recover from B the price (and interest) he (A) had given?
ANS.: Yes. As a rule, if the right of action is based
upon the incapacity of anyone of the contracting parties,
the loss of the thing shall not be an obstacle to the success
of the action. Here, the minor was not guilty of fraud or
fault. (Art. 1401, 2nd par.)

Art. 1402. As long as one of the contracting parties does
not restore what in virtue of the decree of annulment he is
bound to return, the other cannot be compelled to comply
with what is incumbent upon him.

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
(1) Unenforceable Contracts Distinguished from Voidable

and Rescissible Contracts

(3) Effect of Loss through Fortuitous Event

Unenforceable contracts cannot be sued upon or enforced
unless ratified; thus, it is as if they have no effect yet. But they
may be ratified; hence, they can have in such a case the effect
of valid contracts. In one sense, therefore, they may be called

Suppose the innocent party cannot restore because of a
loss through a fortuitous event, may he still compel the other
to return what he had given?

validable.

ANS.: It would seem that the answer is NO, because before
annulment, the contract is valid, and the innocent party, being
the owner of the thing lost by a fortuitous event, must bear the
loss. There is however an exception, and it occurs when he offers
to give the value of the thing. (He does not have to give interest
in view of the fortuitous event.) He must be allowed this remedy,
otherwise, he would be in a worse position than one who had
destroyed the thing through his fault. Once he exercises this
remedy, he can recover from the other what has been previously

Voidable and rescissible contracts, upon the other hand,
produce legal effects until they are annulled or rescinded.

Heirs of Cecilio Claudel, et al. v.
Court of Appeals
GR 85240, July 12, 1991

FACTS: As early as December 28, 1922, Basilio
a.k.a. Cecilio Claudel acquired from the Bureau of Lands
a 10,107 sq. meter lot. He secured a transfer certificate
of title for it in 1933. He declared the lot in his name and
paid the real estate taxes thereon until his death in 1937.
Thereafter, his widow Basilia and later, her son Jose, one
of the petitioners, paid the taxes. Two brothers of Cecilio’s
family contested the ownership over the land. On one
hand the children of Cecilio, the petitioners, the Heirs of
Cecilio, and on the other hand, his brothers and sisters, the
Siblings of Cecilio. In 1972, the Heirs of Cecilio partitioned
the lot among themselves and obtained the corresponding
titles on their shares. Four years later, on Dec. 7, 1976,
the Siblings of Cecilio filed a complaint for cancellation
of titles and reconveyance with damages, alleging that in
1930 their parents bought from Cecilio several portions of
the lot for P30.00. They admitted that the transaction was
verbal. However, as proof of the sale, the Siblings of Cecilio
presented a subdivision plan of the land, dated March 25,
1930, indicating the portions allegedly sold to the Siblings.
The trial court dismissed the complaint, disregarding the
sole evidence (subdivision plan) presented by the Siblings.
The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on the
following grounds: (1) the failure to bring and prosecute
the action in the name of the real party in interest, namely,
the parties themselves, was not a fatal omission since the
court a quo could have adjudicated the lots to the siblings,
the parents of the heirs, leaving it to them to adjudicate the
property among themselves; (2) the fact of residence in the
disputed property by the heirs had been made possible by
the toleration of Cecilio; (3) the Statute of Frauds applies
only to executory contracts and not to consummated sales
as in the case at bar where oral evidence may be admitted;
(4) the defense of prescription cannot be set up against the
Siblings despite the lapse of over 40 years from the time
the alleged sale in 1930 up to the filing of the complaint for
cancellation and reconveyance in 1976. The action, said the
812

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1403

Court of Appeals, was not for the recovery of possession of
real property but for the cancellation of titles issued to the
heirs in 1973. Since the Siblings commenced the complaint
for cancellation of titles and reconveyance with damages
on Dec. 7, 1976, only four years after the heirs partitioned
the lot among themselves and obtained the corresponding
transfer certificates of titles, then there is no prescription of
action yet. So, the Court of Appeals ordered the cancellation
of the Transfer Certificates of Title issued in the names
of the heirs and, corollarily, the execution of the deeds of
reconveyance in favor of the siblings.

ISSUES: Whether a contract of sale of land may be
proven orally; and whether the prescriptive period for filing
an action for cancellation of titles and reconveyance with
damages should be counted from the alleged sale upon
which they claim their ownership in 1930 or from the date
of the issuance of the titles sought to be cancelled in favor
of the heirs in 1976.
HELD: The Supreme Court reversed the decision of
the Court of Appeals, and reinstated that of the trial court,
which ruled for the dismissal of the suit for cancellation
of titles and reconveyance. It held that a sale of land, once
consummated, is valid regardless of the form it may have
been entered into. Nowhere does law and jurisprudence
prescribe that the contract of sale be put in writing before
such contract can validly cede or transmit rights over a
certain real property between the parties themselves. But
if a third party, as in this case, disputes the ownership
of the property, the person against whom that claim is
brought cannot present any proof of such sale and, hence,
has no means to enforce the contract. Thus, the statute
of frauds was precisely devised to protect the parties in a
contract of sale of real property so that no such contract is
enforceable unless certain requisites, for purposes of proof,
are met. Therefore, except under the conditions provided
by the Statute of Frauds, the existence of the contract of
sale made by Cecilio with his siblings cannot be proved.
The belated claim of the siblings who filed a complaint
only in 1976 to enforce a right acquired allegedly as early
as 1930, is difficult to comprehend. The Civil Code states:
813

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1403

The following actions must be commenced within six years:
(1) upon an oral contract. If the Siblings had allegedly
derived their right of action from the oral purchase made
by their parents in 1930, then the action filed in 1976 would
have prescribed. More than six years had elapsed.
(b)

How the Statute of Frauds Prevents Fraud
Since memory is many times unreliable, oral
agreements may sometimes result in injustice. To
aid human memory, to prevent the commission of
injustices due to faulty memory, to discourage intentional
misrepresentations, are the principal aims of the Statute
of Frauds. (Facturan v. Sabanal, 81 Phil. 512)

(c)

Perjuries.” (Black’s Law Dictionary, pp. 813-814;

Houseley v. Strawn Merchandise Co., [Tex. Com. App.]
291 S.W. 864, 867)
(e)

Some Basic and Fundamental Principles Concerning the
Statute of Frauds (General Rules of Application)
1) The Statute of Frauds applies only to executory
contracts (contracts where no performance has yet

been made) and not partially or completely executed
(consummated contracts). (Almirol and Carino v.

First Country to Enact Statute
England was the first country to adopt a Statute of
Frauds. In 1676, the English Parliament passed a law or
statute requiring certain agreements to be in writing. Since
that time, the statute has been called Statute of Frauds.
(National Bank v. Philippine Vegetable Oil Co., 49 Phil.
857)

(d)

History, Chief Characteristics, and Object of the Statute of
Frauds:
1)

2)

3)

The Statute of Frauds is the common designation
of a very celebrated English Statute (29 Car II C,
3), passed in 1676, and which has been adopted in a
more or less modified form, in nearly all of the United
States (and in the Philippines).

2)

Its chief characteristic is the provision that no suit
or action shall be maintained on certain classes of
contracts or engagements unless there is a note or
memorandum thereof in writing signed by the party
to be charged or by his authorized agent.

3)

Its object was to close the door to the numerous
frauds which were believed to be perpetrated and the
perjuries which were believed to be committed when
such obligations could be enforced upon no other
evidence than the mere recollection of witnessess. It
is more fully named as “the Statute of Frauds and
814

Art. 1403

Monserrat, 48 Phil. 67; Asturias Sugar Central,
Inc. v. Montinola, 69 Phil. 725; and Facturan v.
Sabanal, 81 Phil. 512) If oral evidence will not be
allowed to prove an agreement where one party has
performed his obligation, unfairness would result.
(National Bank v. Phil. Veg. Oil Co., 49 Phil. 857)
Indeed, oral or parol evidence may be introduced to
prove partial performance. If documentary or written
evidence would still be required for the proof of partial
performance, the precise evil sought to be avoided by
the Statute of Frauds would be present, namely, one
who has received some benefits would be allowed to
defraud the grantor thereof. (Carbonel v. Poncio, et
al., L-11231, May 12, 1958)
The Statute of Frauds cannot apply if the action is
neither for damages because of the violation of an
agreement nor for the specific performance of said
agreement. (Lim v. Lim, 10 Phil. 635; and Facturan
v. Sabanal, 81 Phil. 512)
The Statute of Frauds is exclusive, that is, it applies
only to the agreements or contracts enumerated
herein. (See Quintos v. Morota, 54 Phil. 481; also the
rule of Statutory Construction which states:“Inclusio
unios est exclusio alterius” what the law does not
include, it excludes. Or, the enumeration of certain
things excludes all those not so enumerated.)

4)

The defense of the Statute of Frauds may be waived.
(See Art. 1405, Civil Code; see also Conlu v. Araneta

816

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

and Guanko, 15 Phil. 387; Magalona v. Parayco, 59
Phil. 453; and Tangco v. Vianzon, 50 Phil. 698)
5)

The Statute of Frauds is a personal defense, that is,
a contract infringing it cannot be assailed by third
persons. (Art. 1408, Civil Code; see Moore v. Crawford,
130 U.S. 122)

6)

[NOTE: Had A’s attorney not objected, the defense
would have been waived, and specific performance could
have been ordered. (Art. 1405, Civil Code; and Conlu v.
Araneta and Guanko, 15 Phil. 387)]

(b)

Contracts infringing the Statute of Frauds are not
void; they are merely unenforceable. (Art. 1403, Civil

8)

9)

The Statute of Frauds is a Rule of Exclusion, i.e.,
oral evidence might be relevant to the agreements
enumerated therein and might therefore be admissible
were it not for the fact that the law or the statute
excludes said oral evidence. (See Jones on Evidence,
Sec. 1425)
The Statute of Frauds does not determine the
credibility or weight of evidence. It merely concerns
itself with the admissibility thereof.
The Statute of Frauds does not apply if it is claimed
that the contract does not express the true agreement
of the parties. As long as the true or real agreement
is not covered by the Statute of Frauds, it is provable
by oral evidence. (Cayugan v. Santos, 34 Phil. 100)

— The Statute of Frauds
applies only to executory contracts:

(8) Examples of the First Principle

(a)

A sold to B real estate for a stipulated price. The agreement
was oral. A has not yet delivered the real estate. B has not
yet paid the price. B offered to buy, but A refused to go
ahead with the agreement. Under the Statute of Frauds,
to be enforceable, an agreement for the sale of real estate
must be in writing (Art. 1403, [2e]); B sued for specific
performance. A’s attorney objected, setting up the Statute
of Frauds as the reason for the objection. May the contract
be proved by oral evidence?
ANS.: No. The agreement being merely executory,
the agreement cannot be proved. Therefore also, A cannot
be compelled to deliver. (See Santos v. Rivera, 33 Phil. 1)
816

Suppose in problem (a), the price had already been paid,
would your answer be the same?

ANS.: No, the answer would not be the same. Here
the objection of A’s lawyer will not prosper. The Statute
of Frauds will not apply because the contract has already
been executed or performed, at least on the side of B. (See
Almirol, etal.v. Monserrat, 48 Phil. 67; Robles v. Lizarraga
Ramos, 50 Phil. 387; see also Art. 1405 of the Civil Code
which says that “contracts infringing the Statute of Frauds
. . . are ratified ...by the acceptance of benefits under them.")
[NOTE: Why is the Statute applicable only to
executory contracts and not to those frilly or partially
performed?

Code)
7)

Art 1403

(c)

ANS.: Because the possibility for fraud in executory
contracts is much greater. As a result, were the rule
otherwise, many would perjure themselves on the witness
stand. (See Hernandez v. Andal, 78 Phil. 196; see also
Chason v. Cheeley, 6 Ga. 554)]
By virtue of an oral contract of sale, seller delivered to
buyer a piece of land which was partially paid. May seller
recover balance of price?

ANS.: Yes, since the contract has already been
partially executed. (Almirol and Carino v. Monserrat, 48
Phil. 67)
(d)

Through the failure of the would-be buyer, the Manila
Railroad Co., to accept the deed after having orally offered
to buy the house subjected the plaintiff (would-be seller) to
much trouble and annoyance and may therefore be subject
to criticism, still plaintiff has no cause of action for the
Statute of Frauds has been timely pleaded in defense by
the Railroad Co. (Barreto v. Manila Railroad Co., 46 Phil.
964)

817

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(e)

Statute of Frauds applies only to executory contracts
and their enforcement. Both the extensions of the period
of repurchase and the extensions of the lease contracts
are no longer executory, because they have already been
performed and consummated. ( Goejin v. Libo, L-4250, Aug.
21, 1953)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

to the landlord. Landlord, in violation of this agreement,
sold all the crops and refused to give tenant the latter’s
share. Statute of Frauds in defense. Decide.

ANS.: Tenant can recover. While it is true that the
lease should have been in writing, tenant is not asking for
damages because of the breach of the contract of lease. (As
a matter of fact, he was occupying the land.) Rather, the
tenant is asking for damages, because of the violation of
the agreement regarding the crops. Statute of Frauds is
not therefore applicable. (Lim v. Lim, 10 Phil. 635)

Maria Paterno, et al. v. Jao Yau
L-12218, Feb. 28, 1961

FACTS: A written contract of lease was made for
seven years with the lessee binding himself to construct
a building of strong WOODEN materials on the leased
premises, which would later become the property of the
lessor at the end of the lease. Instead of constructing a
wooden structure, the lessee built a SEMI-CONCRETE
one of much bigger value, allegedly because of an ORAL
extension of the lease to ten years, instead of the original
seven years.

(b)

ISSUE: May testimonial evidence be given in support
of such ORAL extension?
HELD: Yes, for partial performance takes an oral
contract out of the scope of the Statute of Frauds. (27 C.J.
206; and Hernandez v. Andal, 78 Phil. 196) The rule applies
to a lease where the taking of possession and the making
of valuable improvements and the like on the faith of an
oral agreement makes the statute inapplicable; otherwise,
fraud will be committed against lessee. Oral testimony
may thus be admitted to show that partial performance
has been made.
(4) Examples of Principle No. 2

—

The Statute of Frauds is not
applicable when the action is neither for damages because of
the violation of an agreement nor the specific performance of
said agreement.

(a)

Tenant and landlord had an oral contract of lease for two
years. [Under the Statute, to be enforceable, this must be
in writing (Art. 1403, No. 2).] It was also orally agreed that
half of the crops should belong to the tenant; the other half,
818

Art. 1403

Landlord orally agreed with tenant that the former would
sell for a certain price the house occupied by tenant to the
latter, at the end of the lease. Because of said agreement,
tenant introduced improvements amounting to P4.500.
When lease expired, landlord wanted a higher rent.
Tenant refused. Tenant wants to recover the value of the
improvements, and tries to prove the oral agreement of
sale. Landlord sets up the Statute of Frauds. Decide.
ANS.: Tenant can prove by parol (oral) evidence the
oral agreement of sale; after all he was not interested in
the sale, but merely brought it out to justify his claim for
reimbursement for the improvements introduced. (Robles,
et al. v. Lizarraga, et al., 42 Phil. 584)

(c)

Where the purpose of the action was to enforce an alleged
verbal agreement to sell to the plaintiff a parcel of land
which is claimed to have been occupied by the plaintiff as
a tenant since 1912, the court dismissed the case on motion
to dismiss, it appearing that under the Statute of Frauds,
said verbal agreement cannot be enforced, nor evidence
thereon presented, because it has not been made in writing,
nor does it appear in a note or memorandum as required by
said Statute. (Pascual v. Realty Investment, Inc., 91 Phil.
257)

BUT where a parol (oral) contract of sale is adduced
not for the purpose of enforcing it, but as a basis of the
possession of the person claiming to be the owner of the
land, the Statute of Frauds is not applicable.
819

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(d)

Where the complaint does not contain allegations to the
effect that the plaintiff has taken possession of land in
view of the supposed verbal contract he had with the
defendant to purchase it, nor is there any allegation that
the plaintiffhas made improvements thereon because, and
as a consequence, of said supposed contract to sell; and on
the contrary, it alleges that plaintiff occupied the land as a
tenant since 1912, the alleged transaction of “sale" comes
under the Statute of Frauds. (Ibid.)

(5) Examples of Principle No. 3

—

The Statute of Frauds is

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(6) Examples of Principle No. 4
Frauds may be waived:

(b)

An oral sale of a transistor radio for P400 is valid and
enforceable, since the price is less than P500. (See Art.

1403, No. 2-d)
(c)

A defect in the attestation clause of a will was being cured
by oral evidence. No objection was made. Has the defect
been cured?

ANS.: No, the defect has not been cured. Reason:
The Statute of Frauds, its defenses, and its waiver are not
applicable to wills because the Statute of Frauds refers
only to certain contracts and agreements, whereas the
subject of wills and testaments and the formalities which
surround their execution are governed by separate and
specific provisions of law. (Quintos v. Morata, 54 Phil. 481)
(d)

A mutual promise to marry is not governed by the Statute
of Frauds; hence, it may be made orally. (See Art. 1403,
No. 2[a]) Note however, that even if oral promise to marry
is actionable in case of breach, only damages may be
recovered, not specific performance, for specific performance
is generally not a remedy in personal obligations. (See Arts.
1167 and 1170, Civil Code)
820

The defense of the Statute of

In an oral executory contract of the sale of realty, if one
party fails to timely object to oral evidence presented by
the other, it is as if there was a waiver, and the agreement
can be considered completely valid, provided all the other
essential requisites for the transaction are present. (See
Conlu v. Araneta, et al., 15 Phil. 387; and Macfarlane v.
Green, 54 Phil. 551)
(b) There are two ways to waive this defense:
1)

enumerated therein:

A loan of Pl,000 does not have to be in writing to be
enforceable because the contract of loan is not one of those
enumerated in the Statute. Hence, an oral loan of Pl,000
is valid and enforceable.

—

(a)

exclusive, that is, it applies only to the agreement or contracts
(a)

Art. 1403

2)

Timely failure to object to the presentation of oral
evidence to prove the oral agreement.
Acceptance of benefits under them (as when contract
is totally or partially performed). (See Art. 1405, Civil

Code)
(c)

What is meant by a timely objection, or when must the
objection be made?

ANS.: Either after the question about the agreement
is made or after the answer to said question is made: after
the question, if from the question the expected answer is
obvious; after the answer, if the question itself did not reveal
the answer. If, for example, the question is “DID you enter
into the contract of sale?” here obviously, a sale (oral) is
about to be proved and objection must at once be made;
if the objection is raised only after the answer “Yes we
entered into it on July 1, 1951,” the objection is no longer
timely, and the defense of the Statute of Frauds should
be deemed waived. (See Abrenica v. Gonda, et al., 34 Phil.
739) Had the objection been timely, the oral evidence of
the sale should have been inadmissible. (See Barretto v.
Manila Railroad Co., 46 Phil. 964)
(7) Example of Principle No. 5

—

The Statute of Frauds is a
personal defense, that is, an agreement infringing it cannot be
assailed by third persons.

Problem: Tenant was occupying landlord’s house on a
lease contract when landlord sold the house to a buyer orally.
The buyer has not yet given the price and the seller has not
821

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1403

delivered the house. If buyer asks tenant to pay the rent to him,
and tenant refuses on the ground that the sale is unenforceable,
will the tenant’s contention prosper?
ANS.: No, because not being a party to said sale, he cannot
set up the Statute of Frauds. (See Art. 1408, Civil Code; see also
Moore v. Crawford, 130 U.S. 122)

—

Contracts infringing the Statute
of Frauds are not void; they are merely unenforceable.

(8) Example of Principle No. 6

A and B entered into an oral executory sale. The sale is not
void, for if this were so, it cannot be ratified. As in the example
given in No. (7), the contract of sale had also some effect, namely,
that the tenant cannot refuse to pay rent to the new landlord¬
buyer.

— The Statute of Frauds is a rule

(9) Example of Principle No. 7

of exclusion.

A orally sold B a piece of land. Agreement was still
executory. A asked for payment. B refused, setting up Statute of
Frauds. In the court action, A had two witnesses who were ready
to testify that they were present when the agreement was made.
Their testimony would indeed be relevant, but should there be
timely objection on the part of B’s attorney, their evidence would
not be admissible because the Statute of Frauds excludes such
testimony on a matter like this.

—

(10) Example of Principle No. 8 The Statute of Frauds does not
determine the credibility or the weight of evidence. It merely

concerns itself with the admissibility thereof.

To prove an oral sale of land, X wanted to present the oral
testimony of cabinet members, all of whom are men of integrity.
Although they may be very truthful, still their evidence will not
be admitted.

—

(11) Example of Principle No. 9 The Statute of Frauds does not
apply if it is claimed that the contract does not express the true
agreement of the parties. As long as the true or real agreement
is not covered by the Statute of Frauds, it is provable by oral

evidence.

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

A orally sold B a ring allegedly for P700. The contract is
unenforceable, but if A insists that the price was only P400, oral
evidence is allowed.
(12) The Specific Agreements

There are six specific agreements referred to under the
Statute of Frauds. Each one will be illustrated or explained
herein below.

—

(13) Illustration of Specific Agreement No. 1 “An Agreement
that by its terms is not to be performed within a year from the

making thereof.” (Art. 1403, No. 2-a, Civil Code)
(a)

A and B, neighbors, orally agreed that A would sell and B
would buy A’s transistor radio for P200 three years from the
date of the agreement. At the end of three years, A refused
to hand over the radio although B was willing to pay. Is
the agreement enforceable under the Statute of Frauds?

ANS.: No, because under the terms of the contract,
the sale was to be performed at the end of three years. It
should have been, therefore, made in writing. The Statute
recognizes the frailty of man’s memory, and apparently
only one year is the limit.
Had the agreement been that performance would be
made within three months, the agreement, even if oral,
would have been enforceable. (See Boydell v. Drummond,
11 East 142)
(b) A and B, neighbors, orally agreed that from that day, B
would not erect a garage on his property till after three
years. A week later, B began to erect the garage in violation
of the agreement. A complains and B sets up the Statute
of Frauds. Decide.
ANS.: A is correct in complaining. This agreement
does not come under the Statute of Frauds, because here
the performance was to begin right on that day they agreed,
namely, the obligation not to construct. This is not an
agreement that will be performed after a year, performance
was to begin right away. (See Art. 1403 [No. 2-a], Civil
Code)

822

823

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

A servant had an oral contract which allowed him P10.00
a month salary. He served continuously for twelve years.
Master refused payment on the ground that the contract
having lasted for more than one year, the same should have
been in writing to be enforceable. Question: Is the servant
entitled to be paid?
ANS.: Yes. Firstly, the Statute of Frauds (Art. 1403,
No. 2-a) is not applicable because here the performance
began right away; there was no postponement of
performance for a year. Secondly, the Statute is not
applicable to executed or partially executed contracts.
Thirdly, the Statute was designed to prevent, not foster,
fraud. To prevent the servant from collecting would be to
encourage the commission of fraud. (See Arroyo u. Azur, et
al., 76 Phil. 493)
(d) A and B orally agreed in 2016 to marry each other in 2020.
When 2020 came, A refused to marry B, who now seeks
damages. Question: Would B be allowed to prove the oral
agreement?
(c)

ANS.: No, because since the performance was to be
made four years after the agreement, it had to be in writing
to be enforceable. Having been made orally, it cannot be
proved over and above the objection of A or A's counsel. [See
Atienza v. Castillo, et al., 71 Phil. 589; J. Moran dissented
on the ground that in a mutual promise to marry, it does
not matter how long the marriage is deferred because the
first agreement in the Statute is not applicable but the
third agreement does apply
“An agreement made in
consideration of marriage, other than a mutual promise to
marry" (no period of time being stated).]
(e) When Applicable and When Not Applicable
“The broad view is that the Statute of Frauds applies
(in this agreement) only to agreements not to be performed
on either side within a year from the making thereof.
Agreements to be fully performed on one side within a year
are taken out of the operation of the Statute. The Statute of
Frauds was enacted for the purpose of preventing frauds.
It should not be made the instrument to further them.”
(Nat. Bank v. Phil. Veg. Oil Co., 49 Phil. 857)

824

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Babao v. Perez, et al.
L-8334, Dec. 28, 1957
FACTS: An oral agreement was entered into in 1924
which allegedly required plaintiff Babao to improve 156
hectares of forest lands by levelling and planting thereon
coconuts, rice, corn and other crops such as bamboo and
banana trees, as well as to act as administrator of said land.
In return, the defendant Perez bound herself to give and
deliver to Babao or his wife one-half of the whole area of
the land as improved, with all the improvements thereon,
upon her death. Perez died in 1947. A witness testified
that Perez had told Babao, “You leave the Bana estate,
and attend to this land. Have it cleared and planted to
coconut, for that land will eventually fall in your hands.”
A very small portion of the land was then improved with
certain crops.

ISSUE: May Babao, after the owners’ death, get the
half-share allegedly promised him?
HELD: No, because the contract is unenforceable
and cannot be proved by parol or oral evidence. Even if
Babao had partially performed the contract within one
year from the making thereof, still the Statute would apply,
because, in order that partial performance of the contract
may take the case out of the operation of the Statute, it must
appear clearly that full performance had been made by
one party within one year. All that is required is complete
performance has been made by one party, no matter how
many years may have to elapse before the agreement is
performed by the other party, but nothing less than full
performance by one party will suffice. If anything remains
still to be done after the expiration of the year besides the
mere payment of money, the Statute will apply. (Shoemaker
v. La Tondena, 68 Phil. 24; and Nat. Bank u. Phil.Vegetable
OU Co., 49 PhU. 857, 858)
Even if we were to consider the case as one of sale
(in which case, ordinarily partial performance by one

party could make same enforceable), still it cannot be
contended that the Statute will not apply, for here the
agreement (to be one of sale) must be certain, definite,
825

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

clear and unambiguous. Moreover, it should be fair and
reasonable. For after all, the Statute is based on equity. In
this case here, it is not clear exactly how many hectares
would be planted to corn, how many with rice, how many
with bamboo trees, etc. Had Babao planted a very small
portion with com and rice, and the rest with bamboos and
bananas, it is clearly unjust to give him half of the entire
property.
[NOTE: It would seem from this case that while in
general partially executed contracts are NOT covered by the
Statute of Frauds, still under “No. 1, specific agreement,”
only full or complete performance by one side will take the
case out of the operation of the Statute.]

(b) “Special promise” refers to a subsidiary or collateral
promise to pay, like a contract of guaranty. (See Brown v.
Coleman Dev. Co., 34 Ont. L-210)
(c) A was having his house repaired by B, who needed certain
materials. So A told storeowner (of materials), “Give B the
materials. I shall be responsible. I shall stand good.” This
was orally made. Is this a special promise? Is this oral
agreement enforceable?
ANS.: This is not a special promise. This is not a
guaranty. Only A obligated himself. Since this is not a
guaranty, the contract is enforceable, so that the seller
can properly sue A and prove the oral agreement by parol
evidence, over and above A’s objection. (See Reiss v. Memije,
15 Phil. 350)
(d) A asked B to purchase certain properties from C who was
orally assured by A that he (A) would pay for them. Later
C sued A, who pleaded in defense the Statute of Frauds.
Decide.
826

Art. 1403

ANS.: The promise is enforceable even if orally made,
for A was not guaranteeing another’s debt. He merely
promised to pay HIS OWN debt. (Colbert v. Bachrach, 12

(15) Illustration of Specific Agreement No. 3 “An agreement
made in consideration of marriage other than a mutual promise
to marry.” (Art. 1403, No. 2 c, Civil Code)
(a)

Examples of agreements made in consideration of marriage:
1)

marriage settlements. (Art. 122, Civil Code)

donations propter nuptias. (Art. 127, Civil Code)
(b) When the law says “in consideration of marriage,” it really
means “by reason of the marriage.” Thus, the cause of
the donation propter nuptias is not the marriage but the
liberality or the generosity of the giver.
(c) Note that the law says “other than a mutual promise to
marry.” Hence, an oral mutual promise to marry is not
embraced by the Statute of Frauds. The injured party may
present oral evidence of the promise in an action to obtain
actual damages for breach thereof. (Cabague v. Auxilio, 92
Phil. 294)
(d) Example of the Exception:
A and B mutually promised to marry each other. The
promise need not be in writing unless the marriage be
deferred till after the lapse of one year from the agreement.
(See Atienza v. Castillo, et al., 71 Phil. 589) Forbreach of a
mutual promise to marry, the groom may sue the bride for
actual damages and oral evidence of such mutual promise
is admissible. (Cabague v. Auxilio, supra)
2)

Cabague v. Auxilio
92 Phil. 294
FACTS: A has a son B; C has a daughter D. A, B, C,
and D agree together that B will marry D. The agreement
is oral.

ISSUE: If D later on refuses to marry B who has spent
for the necessary wedding preparations, and A and B bring
an action against C and D, will the action prosper?
827

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: A and C should step out of the picture because
it was not they who mutually promised to marry each other
and therefore, to be enforceable, the agreement should be in
writing. The agreement, insofar as the claim for damages
is concerned, is enforceable between B and D, even if made
orally only, because here it is a mutual promise to marry.
In the case of A and C, the agreement should have been
reduced to writing because it is an agreement based on the
consideration of marriage, other than a mutual promise to
marry. (See Art. 1403, No. 2-c, Civil Code)

Art 1403

(b)

Two kinds of agreements are referred to here:
1)

lease of real property for more than one year (note of
personal property)

2)

sale of real property (regardless of price)

Example:
A is B's tenant. Lease is for six months. If oral, lease
is still enforceable, for the period does not exceed one year.

(c)

If lease of real property is exactly one year, the contract
may be oral, since here the period does not exceed one year.

“Interest” in real property may include easement or
usufruct.
(e) A verbal agreement was made between A and B whereby
A agreed to sell and B agreed to buy A’s farm for P100.000.
The price was paid. Possession was not given nor was the
deed delivered, both being refused. B comes to you and
wants to know if he can compel A to give him the deed and
possession. What would you advise?
(d)

ANS.: I would advise B to sue for specific performance
and also ask A to execute the deed of conveyance. The
Statute of Frauds refers only to purely executory contracts;
hence the Statute will not apply in this case. (See Art. 1403,
No. 2[e]; see also Facturan v. Sabanal, 81 Phil. 512) Since
the contract is valid and enforceable, we can now apply
Art. 1357 of the new Civil Code which states that: “If the
law requires a document or other special form, as in the
acts and contracts enumerated in the following Article,
the contracting parties may compel each other to observe
829

Art 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

that form, once the contract has been perfected. This right
may be exercised simultaneously with the action upon the

contract.”

Western Mindanao Lumber Co., Inc. v. Medalle
L-23213, Oct. 28, 1977

The Statute of Frauds generally does not refer to the
creation of an easement of right of way, the right not being
the result of a sale of real property or interest therein.
Cruz v. J.M. Tuason and Co., Inc.
L-23749, April 29, 1977

FACTS: A alleged that B promised to give him (A)
3,000 square meters of land in consideration of A’s services
in a certain transaction. B pleads in defense that since the
promise was not in writing, it is unenforceable under the
Statute of Frauds.
HELD: The Statute of Frauds is inapplicable here,
firstly because the promise to give the land is not a sale of
real property or any interest therein, and secondly, because
A’s services has already been performed. The Statute
cannot apply to completely or partially executed contracts.
Syquia v. Court of Appeals
GR 61932, June 30, 1987

Under said Article, all alleged oral assurances or
promises of the representatives of the lessor that the lessee
should be given priority or a renewal of the lease contract

cannot be enforceable.
>

Also, under the parol evidence rule, the lessee’s claim
that he is entitled to a renewal of the contract of lease for
the reason that the lessors had given him the option to
renew the contract cannot be maintained.

(18) Illustration of Specific Agreement No. 6

— “A representation

as to the credit of a third person."(Art. 1403, No. 2-f, Civil Code)

A was borrowing money from B, and gave C as his reference.
When C was asked regarding A’s credit C said: “You can safely
830

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1408

lend money to A because A is the owner of a parcel of land
and I have the title deeds in my possession.” This was made
orally. Incidentally, A was C's client, C being a lawyer. This
representation by C is not enforceable against him because it
is not in writing. A representation as to the credit of a third
person must be in writing to be enforceable. (See Art. 1403, No.
2-f, Civil Code; see also Cook v. Churchman, 104 Ind. 141, 152)
[NOTE: This must not be confused with a guaranty.
Here no promise to answer for another’s debt is made; there is
merely an assurance that somebody has a certain amount of
credit, made with the intention of enabling the person in whose
favor it is made to obtain credit by virtue of such assurance or
representation. (Reiss v. Memije, 15 Phil. 350)]
[NOTE further that the person making the representation
does not take part in the contract proper. However, his assurance
to the person about to give credit may be considered some form of
agreement. According to Justice J.B.L. Reyes and Justice Puno,
however, “The liability ... is not ex contractu but on tort. This
number, therefore, is improperly included among unenforceable
contracts. In fact, these representations were not included in
the original Statute of Frauds (29 Cas. II) but were dealt with
in Lord Tenterden’s Act (1828)” (9 George IV C. 14). (Reyes &
Puno, Outline of Civil Law, Vol. IV, p. 254)]
(19) Express Trust Concerning Real Property

It will be observed that while the Statute of Frauds makes
no mention of it, still under Art. 1443 of the Civil Code, “no
express trusts concerning an immovable or any interest therein
may be proved by parol (oral) evidence.” Hence, we can safely
conclude that the Statute of Frauds also applies to such express
(conventional) trust.
(20) Duty of the Attorney for the Defendant

If an agreement violates the Statute of Frauds, but an
action is nevertheless brought against one of the parties, his
attorney can do the following.
(a)

File a motion to dismiss. (Rule 16, 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure);
831

Art. 1403

(b)

(b)

The telegram did not describe the property;

(c)

The telegram had not been signed by any authorized
individual in behalf of the seller.
QUESTION: Is the sale enforceable?

ANS.: No, because the telegram, as a note or memo¬
randum, is clearly insufficient for the details abovemen¬
tioned were not placed. (See Basa v. Raquel, 45 Phil. 655)

must do the following:

Present the written agreement or contract;
(b) If this cannot be done, as when the contract is lost, present
a memorandum or note in writing (this may be a page in a
book or in a notebook, etc.) where the important details of
the contract are set forth like description of the property,
the names of the parties, etc., but most important of all,
the party sought to be charged or his agent must have
signed the note or memorandum. Unless there is the
signature, the note or memorandum will be practically
useless. So an entry in the diary of the seller is not the note
or memorandum referred to in the law. (Exception: in the
case of “auction sale.”)

(a)

(c)

If the written agreement has been lost and there is no note
or memorandum, there is still a remedy; present secondary
evidence of the written agreement. This secondary evidence
may of course be in the form of oral testimony or parol
evidence. But this does not mean that an oral contract is
being proved. The fact is, a written contract now lost or
destroyed, is being proved orally. Before this can be done,
of course, proof must be presented that at one time, there
really existed said written agreement, and that said written
agreement is now missing. After this, the contents of said
missing document may now be proved by oral evidence. (See
Art. 1403 [No. 2], opening par.; see also 27 C.J. 259-260)

to a certain place to complete the purchase of a parcel of land
verbally promised to said buyer. BUT

832

(23) Meaning of Formal Requirements of ‘Sufficient Memo¬

randum’
Our Supreme Court, consistent with a well-established
doctrine, has held that no particular form of language or
instrument is necessary to constitute a memorandum or note in
writing under the Statute of Frauds; any document or writing
under the contract or for another purpose, which complies with
all the statutory requirements of the statute as to contents
and signature, may be considered as sufficient memorandum
or note. Thus, the memorandum may be written in pencil or in
ink; it may be filled in or on a printed form. It does not have to
be contained in a single instrument, nor, when contained in two
or more papers, need each paper be sufficient as to contents and
signature to satisfy the Statute. If there are two or more writings
which are properly connected, they may be considered together;
omissions in one may be supplied or clarified by the other,
and their sufficiency will depend as to whether or not, when
construed together, they are able to satisfy the requirement of
the Statute of Frauds as to signature. (Berg v. Magdalena, 92
Phil. 110)
Berg v. Magdalena Estate
92 Phil. 110

FACTS: Berg and Hemady (representing the Magdalena
Estate, Inc.), shortly after liberation, were accused of treasonable
collaboration, and in the meantime, the Department of Treasury
of the United States ordered their properties frozen under the
Trading with the Enemy Act. This Act provided, among other
things, that the individuals whose assets were frozen were not
allowed to sell, alienate, or otherwise dispose of their properties
833

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1403

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

without prior permission from said Treasury Department. In
view of this requirement, the two, Berg and Hemady, filed
separately an application with the Department for the purchase
and sale of the property being litigated upon, which covered
the Crystal Arcade. This was done in January, 1946, where the
selling price of P200.000 was fixed. The offer being accepted, the
buyer was then given a period of time within which to pay. Buyer
now asks for specific performance. Seller claims that there was
no written contract of sale, pleading thus the Statute of Frauds
in his defense. Decide.

“In order that we can facilitate the transaction of the
sale in question, we (Mrs. Espino and I) are going there
(Puerto Princesa, Pal.) to be there during the last week of
May.”
Paredes also attached both a previous letter from Espino

(re the offer) and a telegram from Espino advising Paredes of

Espino’s arrival by boat. Espino’s defense was that there was
no written contract of sale, and that, therefore, the contract is
unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.

HELD: The contract is enforceable. The Statute of Frauds
does not require that the contract itself be in writing. A written
note or memorandum signed by the party charged (Espino) is
enough to make the oral agreement enforceable. The letters
written by Espino together constitute a sufficient memorandum
of the transaction; they are signed by Espino, refer to the
property sold, give its area, and the purchase price
the
essential terms of the contract. A “sufficient memorandum” does
not have to be a single instrument it may be found in two or
more documents.

HELD: The sale is enforceable because there was a
sufficient note or memorandum evidenced by the applications
for purchase and sale made by Hemady and Berg with the
Treasury Department. Said applications constitute adequate
proof to evidence the agreement being questioned. Furthermore,
all the contractual requirements are present: parties, cause or
consideration, and subject matter. (See discussion in No. [23])

Cirilo Paredes v. Jose L. Espino
L-23351, March 13, 1968
FACTS: Cirilo Paredes filed an action against Jose L.
Espino to execute a deed of sale and to pay damages. In his
complaint, Paredes alleged that Espino has sold to him Lot No.
62 of the Puerto Princesa Cadastre at P4.00 a square meter;
that the deal had been closed by “letter and telegram”; but that
actual execution of the deed of sale and payment of the price were
deferred to the arrival of Espino at Puerto Princesa, Palawan;
that Espino upon arrival had refused to execute the deed of
sale although Paredes was able and willing to pay the price;
that Espino continued to refuse despite written demands by
Paredes; that as a result, Paredes has lost expected profits from
a resale of the property. As proof of the sale, Paredes annexed
the following letter signed by Espino

z

Of what statutes is the term “Statute of Frauds” descriptive?
To what kind of contract are these statutes applicable, and in
what kind of actions may they be invoked?
ANS.:
(a)

The term “Statute of Frauds” is descriptive of those laws,
statutes, or provisions which require certain agreements
to be in writing before they can be enforced in a judicial
action. The law considers the memory of man unreliable,
hence the need for the writing. The statute was designed
to prevent fraud and the commission of perjury. (See Nat.
Bank v. Phil. Veg. Oil Co., 49 Phil. 857)

(b)

These statutes are applicable only to executory contracts,
not to partially or totally executed or performed contracts.
(Facturan v. Sabanal, 81 Phil. 512)

(c)

These statutes may be invoked in actions for damages
for breach of said agreement or for specific performance

Gerardo Cordial v. David Miranda
GR 135492, Dec. 14, 2000

(25) BAR

In a certain registration proceedings, the applicant A
testified that he had been in the possession of the land sought
to be registered since the year 1912, when B, oppositor’s
predecessor in interest, sold the same to him under a verbal
contract for Pl,000. The oppositor asked for the striking off of
the statement of A regarding the alleged verbal contract of sale
of the property on the ground that the same cannot be proved
under the Statute of Frauds. Is the oppositor’s petition tenable?
Reason out your answer briefly.

ANS.: If A’s possession was because the land had been
delivered to him by the seller B, then the contract is already
executed, at least on B’s part, and not merely executory; hence,
the Statute of Frauds is not applicable. The verbal contract of
sale can thus be proved, and the oppositor’s contention is not
tenable. (SeeAlmirol, et al. v. Monserrat, 46 Phil. 67;andDiama
v. Macalibo, 74 Phil. 70)

Unless otherwise provided by law, a contract is obligatory
in whatever form it is entered into, provided all the essential
requisites are present. When a verbal contract has already been
completed, executed or partially consummated, its enforceability
will not be barred by the Statute of Frauds, which applies only
to an executory agreement.
Art. 1404. Unauthorized contracts are governed by Article
1317 and the principles of agency in Title X of this Book.

COMMENT:

Unauthorized Contracts
(a) See comments under Art. 1317, Civil Code.
(b)

(26) Rule on Authority of the Agent to Sell Land or Any

Interest Therein
Under the Civil Code, “when a sale of a piece of land or any
interest therein is through an agent, the authority of the latter
shall be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void.” (Art. 1874)
Note that the law says “void,” not merely unenforceable.
(27) Oral Promise to Put in Writing

An oral promise to put in writing an agreement that is
covered by the Statute is itself unenforceable. (37 C.J.S. 745)
(28) The Third Kind of Unenforceable Contract

The third kind of unenforceable contract is one where both
parties are incapacitated to give consent.

Example: A contract entered into by two unemancipated
minors without parental consent.
836

Ratification cures an unauthorized contract. Unless
ratified, the contract has no effect. (Tagaytay Dev. Co. v.
Osorio, 69 Phil. 180)

Art. 1405. Contracts infringing the Statute of Frauds,
referred to in No. 2 of Article 1403, are ratified by the failure
to object to the presentation of oral evidence to prove the
same, or by the acceptance of benefits under them.

COMMENT:
(1) Ratification of Contracts Infringing the Statute of Frauds

Two ways of ratification of contracts infringing the Statute
of Frauds are given here:
(a)

failure to object to the presentation of oral evidence (this is
deemed a waiver). (See Domalagan v. Bolifer, 33 Phil. 471)
(b) acceptance of benefits under them (thus, the statute does
not apply to executed or partially executed or performed
contracts). (Hernandez v. Andal, 78 Phil. 196)
837

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1406-1407

[NOTE: Partial performance of a contract of sale
does not only occur when part of the purchase price is
paid. There are other acts of partial performance such as
possession, payment of taxes, building of improvements,
tender of payment plus surveying of the lots at the buyer’s
expense. (Ortega v. Leonardo, L-11311, May 28, 1958)]

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1408

parties shall give the contract the same effect as if only one
of them were incapacitated.
If ratification is made by the parents or guardians, as the
case may be, of both contracting parties, the contract shall be
validated from the inception.

COMMENT:

(2) Example of Waiver

Cross-examination of the witnesses testifying orally on the
contract amounts to a waiver or to a failure to object. (Abrenica
v. Gonda and De Gracia, 34 Phil. 739)
Art. 1406. When a contract is enforceable under the
Statute of Frauds, and a public document is necessary for its
registration in the Registry of Deeds, the parties may avail
themselves of the right under Article 1357.

COMMENT:
(1) Right of One Party to Compel the Other to Execute the

Needed Instrument

Contract Where Both Parties Are Incapacitated
Example: A and B, both 15 years old, entered into a contract.
The contract is unenforceable because both parties cannot give
consent. Now if the guardian or parent of A ratifies expressly or
impliedly the contract, it becomes voidable, valid unless annulled
by the guardian or parent of B. However, if the guardian or
parent of B also ratifies, the contract is validated right from the
time it was first entered into.

Art. 1408. Unenforceable contracts cannot be assailed by
third persons.

COMMENT:

It must be stressed here that the right of one party to have
the other execute the public document needed for convenience
in registration, is given only when the contract is both valid and
enforceable. (See comments under Art. 1357, Civil Code)
(2) Example

A sale of realty in a private instrument is not valid and
enforceable; hence, a public document may be executed so that
the sale could be registered. An oral sale of real property is not
enforceable; hence, one party cannot compel the other to execute
the public document. However, if said oral sale of real property
has been ratified, then it is now both valid and enforceable, and a
public document may be made so that the sale can be registered.

Art. 1407. In a contract where both parties are incapable
of giving consent, express or implied ratification by the parent,
or guardian, as the case may be, of one of the contracting
838

Strangers Cannot Assail Unenforceable Contracts

Just as strangers cannot attack the validity of voidable
contracts, so also they cannot attack a contract because of its
unenforceability. Indeed, the Statute of Frauds cannot be set
up as a defense by strangers to the transaction. (Ayson v. Court
of Appeals, 97 Phil. 965)
Problem: Willie, husband of Connie, sold paraphernal
property in her name without her (Connie’s) comment. Was
such sale valid, void, voidable, rescissible, or unenforeceable?
Explain.

Answer: Under the general principle on contracts, the
contract is unforceable if entered into in the name of another
without authority. (Art. 1317, Civil Code)
Assuming that Willie, the husband of Connie, was the
latter’s agent, under the law on agency which was taken from
839

Art. 1408

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the old Statute of Frauds (Art. 1374, id.), if a sale of a piece of
land or any interest therein is through an agent, the authority
of the latter shall be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void.

To reconcile those two provisions, Art. 1317 (Id.), should
apply if the property sold was movable and Art. 1874 (Id.) shall
apply if the property sold is immovable, the contract is unen¬
forceable, and if the property is immovable, the contract is void.

building restrictions (such as limiting the construction of
buildings to those of the character of residences'). (Rafaela
V. Trias u. Gregorio Araneta, Inc., L-20786, Oct. 30, 1965)

Thus, Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes notes: “Did not exist at the
time of the transaction” should be “could not come into existence
because the object may legally be a future thing.” (See Arts. 1347,

correct because there can be valid contracts involving future
property; Example: sale of future or after-acquired property.

document where the latter purportedly resold to Encabo
the house and rights over the lot. Afterwards, Carino
sought the LTA’s approval of the transfer of rights to the
lot in question on the basis of the Deed of Sale executed
by Encabo. The LTA held that the status quo should be
maintained. When Carino refused to give up possession
of the lot, Encabo filed an action with the CFI to declare
them the owners of the lot. The CFI rendered a decision in
favor of Encabo. The Court of Appeals sustained the CFI

(4) Simulated Contracts
(a)

If absolutely simulated, the contract is void for utter lack
of consent.

(b)

If relatively simulated, the hidden or intended contract is
generally binding. (Onglengco v. Ozaeta, 70 Phil. 43)
Castillo v. Castillo
L-81238, Jan. 22, 1980

(now RTC).

If a mother sells to her child, property at a price
very much lower than what she had paid for it, only
three months before, this is an indication that the sale is
fictitious.

HELD: Exhibit D-l is simulated. The Carinos could
not produce the receipts evidencing their alleged payments
to the Land Authority. The simulated deed of sale in favor
of Carino was executed to protect the money Quesada
invested in the purchase of the rights, which transfer was
later disapproved by the LTA. There has been no legal
transfer of rights in favor of Carino because neither the
LTA nor the Land Authority has approved or given due
course to such transfer of rights. Since no approval or due
course has been given by the LTA or LA, the document is
unenforceable against the LTA.

Cariio v. Court of Appeals
GR 47661, July 31, 1987

FACTS: P. Encabo formally applied with the Land
Estates Division, Bureau of Lands, to purchase a parcel of
land. Thereafter, Encabo, through C. Vicencio, supposedly
as “agent,” came to an agreement with J. Quesada
transferring rights over the lot to the latter, conditioned
on approval by Land Tenure Administration (LTA). C.
Vicencio’s husband (J. Carifio) is a relative of J. Quesada.
The transfer of rights by Encabo to Quesada was not put in
writing, but payment of the price for the rights transferred
was evidenced by receipts on which C. Vicencio signed
as a witness. The LTA unaware of the transfer of rights
by Encabo to J. Quesada adjudicated the lot in favor of
Encabo. The LTA and Encabo signed an agreement to
sell. The LTA later came to know about the “transfer” of
rights from Encabo to Quesada. It disapproved the same
because Quesada was not qualified to acquire the lot since
he was already a lot owner. Before LTA’s disapproval of
the transfer of Encabo’s right to Quesada, the latter took
possession of the lot. Quesada also allowed Vicencio to
occupy it.

Later, Encabo executed a deed of sale (Exhibit D-l)
conveying his rights to Vicencio, subject to LTA’s approval.
Encabo then wrote the LTA seeking permission to transfer
his rights. Thereafter, Encabo and Quesada executed a

was ruled that under RA 477, if the applicant for public
land from the NAFCO (Nat. Abaca and Other Fibers

award or the signing of the contract of sale, said transfer is
null and void, and disqualifies such applicant from further

COMELEC, etc. v. Judge Ma. Luisa QuijanoPadilla RTC of QC Br. 215 & Photokina
Marketing Corporation
GR 151992, Sept. 18, 2002

FACTS: Photokina's bid is beyond the amount

appropriated by Congress for the VRIS Project. VRIS

stands for voters’ Registration and Identification System.
The VRIS Project envisions a computerized database
system for the May 2004 Elections. The idea is to have a
national registration of voters whereby each registrant’s
fingerprints will be digitally entered into the system and
upon completion of registration, compared and matched
with other entries to eliminate double entries. A tamper¬
proof and counterfeit-resistant voter’s identification card
will then be issued to each registrant as a visual reword
of the registration.

ISSUE: Can Photokina, although the winning
bidder, compel the COMELEC to formalize the contract
with it notwithstanding that its bid exceeds the amount
appropriated by Congress for the project?
HELD: No. The proposed contract is not binding upon
the COMELEC and is considered void. Verily, the contract
is inexistent and void ab initio. (Art. 1409, Civil Code)
This is to say that the proposed contract is without
force and effect from the very beginning or from its
incipiency, as if it had never been entered into, and, hence,
cannot be validated either by lapse of time or ratification.
(See Manila Lodge u. CA, 73 SCRA 162 [1976]) (See also
Tongoy v. CA, 123 SCRA 99 [1983])
Enshrined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution is the
mandate that “no money shall be paid out of the Treasury
except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.”
(Sec. 29[1], The 1987 Phil. Const.) Thus, in the execution
847

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1409

of government contracts, the precise import of this
constitutional restriction is to require the various agencies
to limit their expenditures within the appropriations made
by law for each fiscal year.
Complementary to the abovecited constitutional
injunction are pertinent provisions of law and administrative
issuances designed to effectuate said mandate in a detailed
manner Secs. 46 and 47, respectively, Chapter 8, Subtitle
B, Title 1, Book V of EO 292, otherwise known as the
“Administrative Code of 1987.” Section 46 provides that
“In]o contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall
be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefore,
the unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations,
is sufficient to cover the proposed expenditures.” Section
47 provides that “no contract involving the expenditure
of public funds by any government agency shall be
entered into or authorized unless the proper accounting

official of the agency concerned shall have certified to the
officer entering into the obligation that funds have been
duly appropriated for the purpose and that the amount
necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current
calendar year is available for expenditure on account
therefore subject to verification by the auditor concerned.”
Quite evident from the tenor of the language of the law
is that the existence of appropriations and the availability
of funds are indispensable prerequisites to or conditions
sine qua non for the execution of government contracts.
The obvious intent is to impose such conditions as a priori
requisites to the validity of the proposed contract. Using
this as premise, the Supreme Court said it “cannot accede
to Photokina’s contention that there is already a perfected
contract.”

Extant on the record is the fact that the VRIS Project
was awarded to Photokina on account of its bid in the
amount of P6.588 billion. However, under RA 8760 ( General
Appropriations Act, FY 2000), the only fund appropriated
for the project was Pl billion and under the Certification
of Available Funds (CAF) only Pl.2 billion was available.
Clearly, the amount appropriated is insufficient to cover
the cost of the entire VRIS Project. There is no way the
848

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1409

COMELEC could enter into a contract with Photokina whose
accepted bid was way beyond the amount appropriated by
law for the project. The objection of then COMELEC chair
Harriet O. Demetriou to the implementation of the VRIS
Project, ardently carried on by her successor, Chair Alfredo
L. Benipayo, are, therefore, in order.
Be this as it may the Notice of Award, being in the
eyes of the law null and void, there is authority that in
the absence of any reservation in the contract, public

authorities cannot, without incurring liability for breach
of contract, after a bid has been accepted and the contract
awarded, rescind such award and contract, except for
some cause which, is the eye of the law, renders it void
or voidable. (64 Am Jur 2d Sec. 79 citing United States v.
Corliss Steam Engine Co., 91 U.S. 321, 23 L Ed 397; and
State ex rel. Robert Mitchell Furniture Co. v. Toole, 26
Monte 22, 66 P496)
Petitioners COMELEC Commissioners are, therefore,
justified in refusing to formalize the contract with
Photokina. Prudence dictated them not to enter into a
contract not backed up by sufficient appropriation and
available funds. Definitely, to act otherwise would be a
futile exercise for the contract would inevitably suffer
the vice of nullity. After all, the contracting prerogative
of public officers is circumscribed with a heavy burden
of responsibility. They must exercise utmost caution and
observe the law in order to protect the public from unjust
and inequitable government contracts. In sum, the case
at bar provides occasion to stress that with respect to
government contracts, statutes take precedence over the
public officers’ freedom to contract.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1409

(8) Contracts Prohibited under the Constitution

QUERY: What are examples of the contracts contemplated
by the charter? May a member of Congress borrow money from
the Philippine National Bank or the Rehabilitation Finance
Corporation (now the Development Bank of the Philippines)?

ANSWER:
(a) The framers of the Constitution could not have intended to
deprive a member of Congress of the facilities and services
of the Manila Hotel, the Light Railway Transit (LRT), etc.
Yet when a Senator or Representative hires a room in the
Manila Hotel, rides in an aircraft of the Philippine Air
Force, or deposits money in the Philippine National Bank,
a contract is made between him and the government entity
concerned, and such a contract is obviously NOT within
the purview of the prohibition in question. The prohibited
contracts are those that involve a financial investment

or business of which the member of Congress expects to
derive gain; for instance, a contract to construct a fly-over
bridge or build a road, a contract to furnish materials or
supplies, or a contract to buy, sell, or lease real or personal
property. Here, a member of Congress may be tempted to
misuse his official prestige and influence.
(b) There is no doubt that a member of Congress may deposit
money with the Philippine National Bank although he
may earn interest. He does so because to him, the PNB
may be the safest place to keep his money. If instead
of depositing (lending) money, he borrows money, with
sufficient guaranties, he in effect makes it possible for the
Bank itself to profit from its investment. It is clear therefore
,
that to obtain the loan could not have been intended by the
drafters of the Constitution as a prohibited transaction.
(See Opinion of the Secretary of Justice, Opinion No. 49,
series of 1948)
(9) Some Characteristics of Void Contracts
(a)

The right to set up the defense of illegality cannot be
waived (Art. 1409, Civil Code), and may be considered on
appeal even if not raised in the trial court. (Garrido v. Perez
Cardenas, 60 Phil. 964)
850

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1409

(b)

The action or defense for their declaration as inexistent
does not prescribe. (Art. 1410, Civil Code)

(c)

The defense of illegality of contracts is not available to
third persons whose interests are not directly affected.
(Art. 1421, Civil Code)

(d)

Cannot give rise to a contract; thus “a contract which is
the direct result of a previous illegal contract is also void
and inexistent.” (Art. 1422, Civil Code)
Generally produces no effect.

(e)

(f)

Generally, no action to declare them void is needed, since
they are inexistent from the very beginning.

(g)

They cannot be ratified. (Art. 1409, Civil Code)
[NOTE: If a new and valid contract is entered into
about the same thing, the new contract is of course binding,
but this is not technically the “ratification” referred to in
the law. Thus, a donation of land in a private instrument
is void, but if a month later the same donation is made
in a public instrument, the donation becomes valid, but
this time, the new contract becomes valid and effective,
not from the date of the original agreement, but from the
date of the new agreement, for technically there has been
no ratification.]
[NOTE: In the case of Garrido v. Perez Cardenas, 60
Phil. 964, it was held that if a contract is entered into and
the obligation is assumed by the debtor in order to prevent
the prosecution of the debtor for a criminal offense, the
same is void for being contrary to law and public order.
But if the purpose be different, there is a chance that the
contract would be valid. In the Garrido case, a certain
Atty. Camus was charged by Garrido with swindling
him in the amount of P2,000. The fiscal (now prosecutor)
advised Camus to settle the matter with Garrido, otherwise
he would prosecute him (Camus). So Camus guaranteed
payment of the amount with Atty. Perez Cardenas, his
employer, as co-signer in solidum. Perez Cardenas never
dealt with Garrido. It was Camus who asked his employer
Perez Cardenas to sign the note. When asked why he signed
851

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1409

the note, Cardenas testified that he did not even know that
a complaint for swindling had been filed against Camus
in the fiscal’s (prosecutor’s) office and was pending; that
he was merely advised by Camus that he had a certain
obligation in favor of Mr. Garrido and that he (Camus)
wanted to have an extension of time within which to pay
it,” and that he signed because he thought he could thereby
help the young man, who was then a lawyer, develop
himself into a better man. It was held that not being
contrary to law, customs, etc. the note was valid insofar as
Cardenas was concerned. The fact that subsequently the
criminal case was withdrawn did not alter the situation
materially.]
[NOTE: In Mactal v. Melegrito, L-16114, March 24,
1961, the court ruled that a promissory note to pay money
illegally converted by an agent (a note signed so that the
estafa case against the plaintiff would be withdrawn) is
VALID because the real consideration for the note was the
pre-existing debt. The dismissal of the estafa case was not
the consideration; it merely furnished the occasion for the
execution of the note.]

The Workmen’s Compensation Act (Sec. 7, Act

by [said] Act.”

(10) Sale of Conjugal Properties

The sale of conjugal properties cannot be made by the
surviving spouse without the formalities established for the
sale of property of deceased persons, and such sale is VOID
as to the share of the deceased spouse. (Ocampo v. Potenciano,
L-2263, May 30, 1951 and Talag v. Tankengco, 92 Phil. 1066)
The vendee becomes a trustee of the share of the latter for the

(11) Who May Attack Contracts Alleged to Be Fictitious or

Void

Gorospe v. Santos
L-30079, Jan. 30, 1976

FACTS: A debtor who had mortgaged his land was not able
to pay the debt, so the mortgage was extrajudicially foreclosed.
He then sold his right to redeem to a third person, who then
proceeded to redeem the property. The creditor-mortgagee who
had purchased the property at the foreclosure questioned this
redemption by the debtor’s assignee on the ground that the
transfer of the right to redeem was simulated or fictitious, but
he could not present proof to overcome the public instrument
respecting the sale of assignment of the right to redeem.
ISSUE: Does the redemption remain valid?
HELD: Yes, firstly because he was not able to overcome the
probative value of the public documents, and secondly, because
whether or not the assignment was fictitious or fraudulent, he,
the mortgagee, cannot be said to have been damaged.

GR 125817, Jan. 16, 2002

ISSUE: When a passenger jeepney covered by a certificate
of public convenience (CPC) is sold to another who continues
to operate it under the same CPC under the so-called 'habit”
853

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1409

system, and in the course thereof the vehicle meets an accident
through the fault of another vehicle, may the new owner sue for
damages against the erring vehicle?

Otherwise stated, does the new owner have any legal
personality to bring the action, or is he the real party-in-interest
in the suit, despite the fact that he is not the registered owner
under the CPC?

HELD: Yes. In the present case, it is at once apparent that
the evil sought to be prevented in enjoining the kabit system
does not exist. Three reasons are adduced, namely.
First, neither of the parties to the pernicious kabit system
is being held liable for damages.
Second, the case arose from the negligence of another
vehicle in using the public road to whom no representation,
or misrepresentation, as regards ownership and operation
of the passenger jeepney was made and to whom no such
representation, or misrepresentation, was necessary. Thus, it
cannot be said that private respondent and the registered owner
of the jeepney were estopped for leading the public to believe
that the jeepney belonged to the registered owner.
Third, the riding public was not bothered nor inconvenienced
at the very least by the illegal arrangement. On the contrary, it
was private respondent himself who had been wronged and was
seeking compensation for the damage done to him. Certainly, it
would be the height of inequity to deny him his right.

In light of the foregoing, it is evident that private
respondent has the right to proceed against petitioners for
the damage caused on his passenger jeepney as well as on his
business. Any effort then to frustrate his claim of damages by
the ingenuity with which petitioners framed the issue should
be discouraged, if not repelled.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1410

Marketing v. LAC, GR 65510, March 9, 1987) Although the

effect, is it incumbent upon the parties to return what they have
received from said sale?

tion of nullity of a contract which is void ab initio operates to
restore things to the state and condition in which they were
found before the execution thereof.

Art 1410. The action or defense for the declaration of the

inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.

This Article is a new provision of the Civil Code. If a contract
is null and void, the action to declare it null and void or to
declare its non-existence is imprescriptible. On the other hand,

preempt and prevail over all abstract arguments based only on

despite the passage of time. Thus, in the case of Angeles, et al.
v. Court of Appeals, 102 Phil. 1006, it was held by the Supreme
Court that the sale of a homestead patent is contrary to law,
and void; and therefore, the action or defense for the declaration
of its nullity and inexistence does not prescribe. Mere lapse of
time cannot give effect to contracts that are null and void.

equity.

Certainly, laches cannot be set up to resist the enforcement
of an imprescriptible legal right, and petitioners can validly
vindicate their inheritance despite the lapse of time.
(2) Query on Whether Void Contract Still Has to Be Declared

Void

The question may be asked: If a void contract is void
from the very beginning, what is the use of its being declared
inexistent?

One who buys land in bad faith (for the buyer should have
known that its possessor had already bought the same) enters
into what is known as a VOID, not merely voidable, contract.
Therefore, any action or defense for the declaration of the
existence of the contract does not prescribe. (Art. 1410, Civil
Code) The mere fact that Art. 1544 does not declare void a deed
of sale registered in bad faith does not mean that said contract
is not void.

Strictly speaking, there is no use. But for purposes of
convenience, or to avoid taking the law into our own hands, there
is nothing wrong in having a void contract declared really void.
For example: A sells B the Jones Bridge and B gives A the price.
Of course, this contract is null and void, but suppose A refuses
to return to B the price, stating that there is nothing wrong with
the contract, what should B do? B should file an action in court
to declare the inexistence of the contract. This right of B to bring
the action does not prescribe. Indeed, the defect in this kind of
contract cannot be cured by prescription or by ratification. (See
Eugenio v. Perdido, 97 Phil. 41; and Dingle v. Guillermo, [CA.]

Buenaventura v. Court of Appeals
GR 50837, Dec. 28, 1992

In case of fraud in the transfer of the property as alleged
in petitioner’s complaint, Art. 1410 of the Civil Code on
imprescriptibility of actions cannot be deemed applicable.

48 O.G. 4410)

Verily, the principle on prescription of actions is designed
to cover situations where there have been a series of transfers
to innocent purchasers for value. To set aside these transactions
only to accommodate a party who has slept on his rights is
anathema to good order. Independently of the principle of
prescription of actions working against petitioner, the doctrine
of laches may further be counted against them, which latter
tenet finds application even to imprescriptible actions. Thus,
while it is true that, technically, the action to annul a void or
inexistent contract does not prescribe; it may, nonetheless, be
barred by laches.

Tolentino v. Paras

A void bigamous marriage, being already void, does NOT
have to be declared void by the courts.
Sps. Narciso Rongavilla & Dolores

The defect of inexistence of a contract is permanent and
incurable; hence, it cannot be cured either by ratification or by
prescription. There is no need of an action to set aside a void or
inexistent contract; in fact such action cannot logically exist.

a criminal offense, both parties being in pari delicto, they
shall have no action against each other, and both shall be
prosecuted. Moreover, the provisions of the Penal Code
relative to the disposal of effects or instruments of a crime
shall be applicable to the things or the price of the contract.
This rule shall be applicable when only one of the parties
is guilty; but the innocent one may claim what he has given,
and shall not be bound to comply with his promise.

Art 1412

COMMENT:
(1) Two Kinds of Illegal Contracts
There are two kinds of illegal contracts:
(a)
(b)

those where there is a criminal offense;
those where there is no criminal offense.

(2) Illegal and Criminal Contracts

Those contracts where there is a CRIMINAL OFFENSE
may be of two kinds:

COMMENT:

(a)

The ‘Pari Delicto’ Rule Refuses Legal Remedy to Either
Party to an Illegal Agreement and Leaves Them Where
They Were

The raison d'etre: Ours are courts of both law and equity
they compel fair dealing and do not abet clever attempts to
escape just obligations. (Abacus Securities Corp. v. AmpU, 483
SCRA 315 [2006])
Where the act involved constitutes a criminal offense, i.e.,
forging a person's signature punishable under Sec. 4, Title IV of
the RPC, the applicable provision is Art. 1411 of the new Civil
Code. In Ramirez v. Ramirez, 485 SCRA 92 (2006), the Supreme
Court held that object and cause, are two separate elements of
a donation and the illegality of either element gives rise to the
application of the doctrine of pari delicto.

—

Art. 1412. If the act in which the unlawful or forbidden
cause consists does not constitute a criminal offense, the
following rules shall be observed:
(1) When the fault is on the part of both contracting
parties, neither may recover what he has given by virtue

of the contract, or demand the performance of the other's
undertaking;
(2) When only one of the contracting parties is at fault,
he cannot recover what he has given by reason of the contract,
or ask for the fulfillment of what has been promised him. The
other, who is not at fault, may demand the return of what he
has given without any obligation to comply with his promise.

858

(b)

those where both parties are guilty (in pari delicto);
those where only one is guilty and the other is

innocent.
NOTE:
(a)

Those where BOTH are GUILTY:
1)

Example: both entered into a contract for smuggling
or importation of contraband. (Iribar v. Millat, 5 Phil.
362)

2)

Effects:
a)

Since they are in pari delicto, they shall have
no action against each other.

b)

Both shall be prosecuted.

c)

The effects or the instruments of the crime
(things or price of the contract) shall be
confiscated in favor of government.
Packaging Products Corp. v. NLRC
GR 50383, July 23, 1987

FACTS: BE was employed by PPC since
1959. While holding the position of Group
Account Executive in 1970, the Corporation’s
Board Chairman assigned him to handle and
develop the account of LTI, which requires 7
million corrugated shipping boxes a year. On
account of the profitability of the assignment,
859

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

BE demanded for and was given an incentive
in the form of 7% commission, which was
different and distinct from the regular one-half
per cent (1/2%) of the aggregate value of the
actual monthly sales to LTI. The arrangement
for paying this commission was that the checks
were made payable to BE after invoice (and
before payment) during the first week of every
succeeding month with the fictitious PRC
appearing in the checks as payee. The use of
the fictitious name was allegedly to cover-up
the rather anomalous situation where a mere
salesman of the corporation could appear to be
earning more than its officers or executives.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

contract. The courts will leave them as they were
at the time the case was filed.

The subject matter of the agreement sought
to be enforced being illegal and immoral, the
resolution of the NLRC ordering the PPC to
pay BE unpaid commissions in the amount of
P272.830, plus legal interest is declared null and
void.
(b)

Those where ONLY ONE is GUILTY (or where, even if
both are guilty, they are not equally guilty, therefore, “not
in pari delicto” “not in equal guilt”):

—

1)

Examples: X sold government property to Y, who was
in good faith; or where a person of age gave a donation
to a minor for the purpose of illicit sexual intercourse.
(See Liguez v. Lopez, 102 Phil. 577)

2)

Effects:

BE served the account of LTI until PPC
took it away from him in 1977. He therefore
charged PPC guilty of diminution of the
benefits and claimed that PPC should pay
him the commissions due him from LTI, Inc.
PPC, on the other hand, contends, that the 7%
commission constituted the commission rebates
given by PPC to certain employees of LTI, and
admitted that the name of PRC was fictitious,
but maintains that the name was used merely
to facilitate the issuance of vouchers and checks
corresponding to the 7% commission rebates.
ISSUE: Is BE entitled to unpaid commis¬
sions equivalent to 7% of total sales he effected,
aside from his regular 1/2% commission, based
on the aggregate value of the actual monthly
sales to LTI?

[NOTE: Even if a contract involves a crime, still if a cause
of action can be established without referring to the illegal act
or motive, relief can be granted by the courts. (Perez v. Herranz,
7 Phil. 693)}

HELD: The Supreme Court cannot give
positive relief to either BE or PPC because it
is asked to interpret and enforce an illegal and

Perez v. Herranz
7 Phil. 693

immoral arrangement. Kickback arrangement
in the purchase of materials and other needs of
manufacturers are void. Both BE and PPC are
in pari delicto. Neither one may expect positive
relief from courts of justice in interpreting their

FACTS: Perez, a Filipino, and Herranz, a Spaniard,
wanted to buy a steamer. So Perez contributed 1/6 of the price,
and Herranz contributed 5/6. But because Herranz, being an
alien, could not buy a Philippine steamer, both agreed that
the purchase would be in the name of Perez alone. So, a false

860

a)
b)

The guilty party will be prosecuted.
The instrument of the crime (or object of the
contract) will be confiscated (as in the case of
government property illegally sold).

c)

The innocent one may claim what he has given
(like the price he paid for the government
property); or if he has not yet given anything, he
shall NOT be bound to comply with his promise.

861

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1412

affidavit was made, and they got the steamer. The false affidavit
was of course illegal. When the steamer was given, Herranz took
possession of it, and when Perez wanted to get it on the ground
that it was registered in his name, Herranz refused. Hence, this
action for recovery.

HELD: Ordinarily in a criminal and illegal contract as
this, the parties should be left as they are by the court, each
having no action against the other. But in this case, even without
referring to the illegal act, a proper cause of action could be
made out. Perez could present a prima facie case in his favor
by presenting the deed of sale; Herranz could allege that it
had been agreed that co-ownership was to exist between them,
and both allegations can be given even without referring to the
illegal affidavit or purpose. Thus, inasmuch as co-ownership
was duly proved, Perez and Herranz were declared co-owners in
proportion to their respective contributions to the price: Perez
was declared owner of 1/6, Herranz, of 5/6.
[NOTE: This was a civil case. No criminal action was
instituted by the government.]
(3) Illegal but Not Criminal Contracts

Those contracts which are unlawful or forbidden BUT
where there is NO criminal offense may be of two kinds:

x

(a)

those where both are guilty.

(b)

those where only one is guilty or at fault.

NOTE:
(a)

Those where both are guilty.
1)

Example: A Filipino sold land to a Chinese after the
effective date of the Constitution. (Pianos v. Gawhok,
[CAJ 50 O.G. 3124, July 1954; and Cabauatan v. Uy
Hoo, 88 Phil. 103)

2)

Effect: Neither may recover what he has given by
virtue of the contract or demand the performance of
the other’s undertaking. (Art. 1412, No. 1) (Thus, in
the example given, the Filipino vendor of his land was
not allowed to recover the land illegally sold; neither
862

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

can the Chinese recover the money paid, for the law
will leave them as they are, since they are in pari
delicto) (See Planas v. Gawhok, [CA.J 50 O.G. 3124,
supra; and Cabauatan v. Uy Hoo, supra)
If a Filipino sells his land to a Chinese citizen,
but the latter sells the land to a Filipino, as a result
of which a new Torrens Transfer Certificate of Title
is issued, the validity of the title can no longer be
questioned. (Natividad Herrera, et al. v. Luy Kim
Guan, et al., L-17043, Jan. 13, 1961)

Philippine Banking Corp. v. Lui She
L-17587, Sept. 12, 1967

The “pari delicto” rule does not apply if in a transfer
to an alien of Philippine land, the government takes no
steps to escheat or to revert the property to the State. If
the alien continues to hold on to the land, there would be a
continuing violation of the Constitution. Hence, the Filipino
assignor should be allowed to get back the property.
De Raquiza v. Castellvi
77 SCRA 88

A party who has voluntarily entered into an illegal
and void compromise agreement cannot withdraw or render
ineffective, acts already done in connection with their part
of the unlawful bargain.
Teja Marketing, et al. v. Naie and IAC
GR 65510, March 9, 1987

FACTS: A purchased a motorcycle with sidecar
from B to engage in the transportation business. For this
purpose, the trimobile was attached to B’s transportation
line, or franchise, so much so that in the registration
certificate B appears to be the owner of the unit. A paid a
downpayment of Pl,700 with a promise that he would pay
B the balance within sixty days. They agreed that B would
undertake the yearly registration of the unit with the Land
Transportation Company. Eventually, B sued A to recover
the unpaid balance. The City Court where the action was
863

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

originally filed as well as the Court of First Instance (now
Regional Trial Court) to which it was appealed ordered A
to pay the unpaid balance, and dismissed his counterclaim.
The Court of Appeals, however, declared the agreement
void, and the parties being in pari delicto, neither of them
may bring an action against the other to enforce their
illegal contract. B assailed the Court of Appeal’s decision.
The Supreme Court sustained the Court of Appeals and
dismissed B’s petition.
HELD: Although not outrightly penalized as a
criminal offense, the “kabit system” is recognized as
contrary to public policy and, therefore, void and inexistent.
The court will not aid either party to enforce an illegal
contract. It will leave them both where it finds them. It
would, therefore, be error to accord the parties relief from
their predicament. Article 1412 denies them such aid.
The “kabit system” is an arrangement whereby
a person who has been granted a certificate of public
convenience allows another person who owns motor vehicles
to operate under such franchise for a fee. A certificate of
public convenience is a special privilege conferred by the
government. Abuse of this privilege by the grantees cannot
be countenanced. The “kabit system” has been one of the
root causes of the prevalence of graft and corruption in
government transportation offices.
(b)

Those where only one is guilty or at fault (or where one
party is less guilty than the other, hence they are not in

pari delicto).
1)

Example: A husband and his wife executed a void
contract dividing their conjugal properties, as a result
of which the wife was given a certain parcel of land.
A certain Bough, who wanted to get the land, lied to
the wife and told her falsely that her husband was in
town and was going to contest the deed of property
separation, in an attempt to induce her to transfer
the land to him (Bough), so that the husband could
not get hold of the properties. So, the wife agreed to
fictitiously transfer the land to him. Later, Bough
brought this action to recover the land and presented
as proof the deed of sale to him. The wife, on the other
864

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

hand, asked for the declaration of the sale as null and
void.

HELD: Although the wife was in delicto, she was
not in pari delicto with Bough who, by fraud, induced
her to enter into an agreement that was against public
policy. Therefore, Bough cannot get the land, and
the wife will retain possession of the same. (Bough
v. Cantiveros, 40 Phil. 209)
2)

Effects:
a)

The guilty party cannot recover what he has
given by reason of the contract, or ask for the
fulfillment of what had been promised him.
(Thus, in the example given, Bough was not
allowed to get the land.) (Bough v. Cantiveros,
40 Phil. 209)

b)

The party not at fault may demand the return
of what he has given, without any obligation to
comply with his promise. (Art. 1412, No. 2)

Land Ownership by Americans
After the Expiration of the Laurel*
Langley Agreement on July 3, 1974
On August 17, 1972, the Supreme Court in the case of
Republic u. William H. Quasha ruled that the “parity rights”
amendment to the 1935 Constitution did not grant American
citizens and entities the right to acquire and own private
lands except in cases of hereditary succession. Under the 1973
Constitution, the Philippine Government had the right from
July 4, 1974, to take positive steps to acquire these lands from
their American holders in view of Art. XVII, Sec. 2, which states
that “titles to private lands acquired by such persons. . . shall
be valid as against private persons only” (thus, not valid as
against the State; thus also, the State can order the reversion
to the State of said lands). In May, 1974, President Ferdinand
Marcos announced the policy of the Government to refrain until
May 28, 1975 from taking any action on the rights of American
individuals or entities (including religious corporations and
associations) with American equity participation beyond 40%.
865

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

(.NOTE: American entities are still allowed to own said lands if
their equity participation or share is only up to 40%.) May 27,

1975 was the last day, therefore, of said grace period. Certain
companies, however, merely submitted concrete proposals for
divestment (instead of immediately effecting divestment of
their holdings). These proposals are now being evaluated by
the Government as to their good faith, reasonableness, and
compliance with Philippine laws and regulations. Submission
of said proposals, coupled with eventual actual transfer to
Filipinos within a reasonable period, is to be considered sufficient
compliance with the terms of the grace period, according to
President Marcos. Said “reasonable period of time” also applies
to American citizens, who, in good faith had acquired lands
in the Philippines not exceeding five thousand (5,000) square
meters for a family dwelling and who have taken sufficient action
to transfer ownership over such lands to qualified persons or
entities. (See Daily Expresss, May 29, 1975)

Mass v. Director of Lands
80 SCRA 269
While aliens were generally not allowed to acquire lands
under the 1935 Constitution, U.S. citizens could generally
do so, and their proprietary rights were not impaired by the
proclamation of Philippine Independence on July 4, 1946.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: Vs purchase is prohibited under Sec. 579 of the
Revised Administrative Code. The sale to her was void. A
void contract is inexistent from the beginning. It cannot be
ratified. Its illegality cannot be waived. Being party to an illegal
transaction, Y cannot recover what she has given by reason of
the contract or ask for the fulfillment of what has been promised
her.
(4) The Pari Delicto Doctrine
(a)

If the two parties to a contract are in pari delicto, the
doctrine applies even to the spouse of one of them, who
although not a signatory to the contract, has sufficiently
manifested by affirmative acts her unequivocal concurrence
to the contract in controversy. (See Montederamos v.
Ynonoy, 56 Phil. 457; and La Urbana u. Villasor, 59
Phil. 644) If the spouses benefit from the transaction, the
acceptance of said benefits raises a strong presumption of
knowledge and consent. (Inco, et al. v. Enriquez, L-13367,
Feb. 29, 1960)

(b)

The doctrine does not apply to fictitious or absolutely
simulated contracts (Gonzales v. Trinidad, 67 Phil. 682),
since these contracts are inexistent (See Vasquez v. Porta,
52 O.G. 7615); not to a contract where one party, a minor,
is much less guilty than another, who is of age (Liguez v,
Lopez, 102 Phil. 577); nor to a case where the government is
involved for the government is not estopped by the neglect
of its officers (Central Azucarera de Tarlac v. Collector,
L-11002, Sept. 30, 1958); nor finally to a contract of sale,
where on account of a breach of warranty due to a double
sale of the same property, damages are suffered in a case
like this the governing articles would be Arts. 1495, 1547,
and 1555 on the law of Sales. (Diosdado Sta. Romana v.
Carlos Imperio, et al., L-17280, Dec. 29, 1965)

Avila v. Court of Appeals
GR 45255, Nov. 14, 1986

FACTS: A parcel of land which had been adjudicated to
X by the Cadastral Court was offered for sale at public auction
on account of realty tax delinquency. Y, a public school teacher,
took part in and won the bidding. Despite the provision of
Sec. 579 of the Revised Administrative Code prohibiting public
school teachers from buying delinquent properties, nobody, not
even the government questioned her participation in said auction
sale. After the redemption period, the provincial treasurer
executed in Vs favor the final deed of sale. Seven years later,
the Original Certificate of Title covering said land was issued in
favor ofX. Y sought to review the decree. The Cadastral Court
set aside the decree and ordered that the land be adjudicated
toF.
866

Art. 1412

—

(c)

The doctrine does not apply where a superior public policy
intervenes. Thus, even if a homestead owner sells it within
the prohibited period and with presumed knowledge that it
is illegal, still the owner or his heir may sue for its recovery,
for the purpose of the law is to grant land to said owner or
867

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

his heir. (See De los Santos v. Roman Catholic Church, 94
Phil. 405; and Angeles v. Court of Appeals, et al., L-11024,
Jan. 31, 1958)
[NOTE: While the doctrine does not apply to the sale of
the homestead, it applies to the loss of the products received
by the buyer and the value of the necessary improvements
made by him on the land. Thus, since both the homesteader
and the buyer are in bad faith, the claim of the heirs of
the homesteader for the products of the land and that
of the buyer for the expenses in the construction of the
dike, should be denied. (Angeles v. Court of Appeals, et al.,
L-11024, Jan. 31, 1958) Moreover, what the homesteader
or his heirs must return is not the increased value of the
property, but only the purchase price paid by the buyer.
(Santander, etal. v. Villanueva and Asuncion, L-6184, Feb.
28, 1958) This ruling on the repurchase price if made is also
applicable to the sale of the homestead AFTER the fiveyear period but with the legal right of redemption would,
however, appear to be unjust if a homesteader, to obtain
money, deliberately sells his land to a reluctant purchaser
(who nonetheless buys the same on the strength of a written
guarantee on the part of the homesteader not to repurchase
the same). In a case like this, there would be FRAUD on the
part of said homesteader. Indeed, the Court’s ruling would
encourage the propagation of a “racket” by homesteader
who make it a practice to sell, and redeem, and later sell
and redeem again, etc. (taking advantage as they do of
the rapid increase of land values). While the purpose of
the law is indeed to protect the homesteaders, there are
also instances when it is AGAINST them that sincere
purchasers should be protected.]
(d)

The “pari delicto” rule does not apply in case of void
contracts which are simulated to circumvent a law. For
instance, a donation between spouses is generally void
under Art. 133 of the Civil Code. And it has been ruled that
in such a case, the property can be reclaimed at anytime by
the donor or his heirs or by any person prejudiced thereby.
To apply the “pari delicto” rule in such a case would be to
sanction a circumvention of the prohibition. (Rodriguez v.
Rodriguez, L-23002, July 31, 1967)

(5) Some Questions on Gambling
(a)

What does the law provide regarding gambling losses and

gains?

ANS.: “No action can be maintained by the winner for
the collection of what he has won in a game of chance. But
any loser in a game of chance may recover his loss from
the winner, with legal interest from the time he paid the
amount lost, and subsidiarily from the operator or manager
of the gambling house.” (Art. 2014, Civil Code)
(b) Suppose in gambling there was cheating or deceit, what
should be done?
ANS.: “If cheating or deceit is committed by the
winner, he, and subsidiarily, the operator or manager of the
gambling house shall pay by way of exemplary damages,
not less than the equivalent of the sum lost, in addition to
the latter amount. If both the winner and the loser have
perpetrated fraud, no action for recovery can be brought
by either.” (Art. 2015, Civil Code)
(c) Suppose the loser refuses to bring the action to recover,
what may be done?
ANS.: “If the loser refuses or neglects to bring an
action to recover what has been lost, his or her creditors,
spouse, descendants, or other persons entitled to be
supported by the loser may institute the action. The sum
thereby obtained shall be applied to the creditors’ claims,
or to the support of the spouse or relatives, as the case may
be.” (Art. 2016, Civil Code)
(d) Suppose the watchers of a game of chance bet on the result
of the game without, however, taking an active part in the
game itself, what rules should be applied?
ANS.: “The provisions of Articles 2014 and 2016
apply when two or more persons bet in a game of chance,
although they take no active part in the game itself.” (Art.
2017, Civil Code)
(e) To prevent pure speculation which really amounts to
gambling, what does the Civil Code provide?
ANS.: “If a contract which purports to be for the
delivery of goods, securities or shares of stock is entered
869

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1412

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

recovery to the guilty parties inter se. It applies to cases where
the nullity arises from the illegality of the consideration or the
purpose of the contract. When two persons are equally at fault,
the law does not relieve them. The exception to this general
rule is when the principle is invoked with respect to inexistent
contracts. (Yu Bun Guan v. Elvira Ong, GR 144735, October 18,

into with the intention that the difference between the
price stipulated and the exchange or market price at the
time of the pretended delivery shall be paid by the loser to
the winner, the transaction is null and void, and the loser
may recover what he has paid.” (Art. 2018, Civil Code).
An example is engagement in derivatives inventory and/
or trading.
(6) ‘Gambling* Distinguished from ‘Betting*

While generally gambling on the results of a game of chance
is prohibited, betting (which concerns itself with games of skill,
like chess) is ordinarily allowed.

Art. 1413

2001)

Art. 1413. Interest paid in excess of the interest allowed by
the usury laws may be recovered by the debtor, with interest
thereon from the date of the payment.

COMMENT:

Thus, the law says:

Meaning of Excess

“The loser in any game which is not one of chance,
when there is no local ordinance which prohibits betting
therein, is under obligation to pay his loss, unless the
amount thereof is excessive under the circumstance.” (Art.
2020, Civil Code)

Strictly speaking, and using the former Usury Law as a
basis, it would seem under this Article that the excess referred
to is the amount in excess of:

[NOTE: The provision in the Revised Penal Code
prohibiting betting on the results of a sports contest would seem
to be inapplicable in cases covered by Art. 2020, otherwise said

Art. 2020 would be rendered nugatory.]

Contracts

(c)

2-1/2% per month; 2% per month; 14% per year (in

in the Civil Code as to which law prevails, the Usury Law
or the Civil Code.

(7) BAR QUESTION

ANS.: Unless there is a local ordinance prohibiting betting
in a chess match, and unless, considering the circumstances of
the case, the sum of Pl 00,000 is excessive (it would not be if,
for example, the players were millionaires), A may successfully
sue B for the P100.000. This is because chess is not a game of

(a)

Note also that under Central Bank Circular 905, the
Usury Law has been repealed, effective January 1, 1983.

Under Arts. 1175 and 1957 of the Civil Code, in case of
conflict, the Usury Law prevails.
(b) Under Art. 1961 of the Civil Code, in case of conflict, the
Civil Code applies.
[NOTE: Now then, under Sec. 6 of Act 2655 (known
as the Usury Law), the person paying the usurious interest
“may recover the whole interest, commissions, premiums,
penalties, and surcharges paid and delivered” as long as the
action for recovery is instituted within two years after such

(a)

871

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1414

payment and delivery (that is, all the interest paid within
the last two years prior to litigation may be recovered).]
[NOTE: It should be noted that under both theories,
legal interest on the interest may also be recovered.]

[NOTE: In one case, the Supreme Court held that the
recovery of the interest is governed by the Civil Code. In
said case, however, the question of the “conflict” was not
discussed. (Cherie Paleleo o. Beatriz Cosio, L-7667, Nov.
28, 1955)]
[NOTE: In the case, however, of Angel Jose
Warehousing Co. v. Chelda Enterprises and David Syjuico,
L-25704, April 24, 1968 (see the cause as given in the
comments under Art. 1 175), the Court held that the entire
interest agreed upon may be recovered, not merely that in
excess of 12% or 14% as the case may be for the entire
interest agreed upon is an indivisible stipulation which
is VOID. On the other hand, the principal loan must be
returned because there is nothing wrong with respect to
this principal obligation. It is only the accessory obligation
(re the interest) that is VOID. However, interest for default
must be paid in addition to the principal.]

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1416

(2) Example

For a reward, A promised to kill C for B. B gave the
reward. Before A could kill C, B repudiated the contract. Is B
allowed to do so? Yes, because here, the purpose has not yet
been accomplished and no damage has as yet been caused to a
third person. May B recover what he has paid? It depends on
the discretion of the court. If public interest allows the party
repudiating the contract to recover the money or property given.
If, however, the repudiation took place after the crime has been
done, such repudiation is invalid and both parties will be guilty.
(3) Comment of the Code Commission

The Code Commission has this to say: “Concerning illegal
contracts, Arts. 1414 (supra) and 1416 (infra) allow recovery by
one of the parties even though both of them have acted contrary
to law.” (Report of the Code Commission, p. 27)
(4) Applicable Even If Parties Are Not Equally Guilty

The Article also applies if the parties are not equally guilty,

illegal purpose, the contract may be repudiated by one of the

allow the party repudiating the contract to recover the money
or property.

(Ramon and Estela Sua). In view of the failure of the lessees to

comply with the terms of the lease contract (e.g., failure to pay
rentals), Ras sued for the rescission of the contract. The lessees
contended, among other things, that the lessor Ras had no right
to sue because of a violation of RA 477, prohibiting the alienation
or encumbering of land acquired from the NAFCO within ten
years from the issuance of the corresponding certificate of title.

merely prohibited contracts.

HELD: Yes, Ras may still sue for the recovery of the land.
RA 477 is silent as to the consequence of the encumbering of the
land within the ten-year prohibited period. But considering that
the aim of the government in allowing the distribution or sale of
disposable public lands to deserving applicants is to enable the
landless citizens to own land they can work on, and considering
that the reversion of these lands to the government is penal in
character, reversion cannot be construed to be implied from the
provision prohibiting certain acts. Where, as in this case, the
interest of the individual outweighs the interest of the public,
strict construction of a penal provision is justified under Art.
1416 of the Civil Code.

(2) Illegal PerSe

Illegal per se contracts are those forbidden because of public
interest.

Merely prohibited contracts are those forbidden because
of private interests. Here recovery is permitted, provided that:

plaintiff;

recovery.

Ineceta Alfanta v. Nolasco Noe, et al.
L-32362, Sept. 19, 1973

COMMENT:

(Social Function of Property Ownership)

(1) Hours of Labor

Under the Constitution, property ownership has been
impressed with a social function. This implies that the owner has
the obligation to use his property not only to benefit himself but
society as well. Hence, it provides that in the promotion of social
justice, the State shall regulate the acquisition, ownership, use,
enjoyment, and disposition of private property, and equitably
diffuse property ownership and profits. The Constitution also
ensures that the worker shall have a just and living wage which
should assure for himself and his family an existence worthy of
human dignity, and give him opportunities for a better life.

This concerns hours of labor. It should be noted that the
Eight-Hour Labor Law applies only to employments in industry
or occupation performed for profit or gain. (Department of Public
Service Labor Union v. CIR, et al., L-15458, Jan. 28, 1961)
(2) Basis of Minimum Wage Rates

The basis of the minimum wage rates is not more than
eight hours daily labor in the case of employees working in
non-agricultural enterprises, and not more than the customary
hours of work in the case of agricultural workers. (Art. 1, Sec.
3, Code of Rules and Regulations to Implement the Minimum
Wage Law, as Amended)

(2) Minimum Wages for Household and Domestic Helpers

Under PD 99 (also found in Chapter III, Title III, Book III,
Labor Code of the Philippines), any househelper who before the
promulgation of the decree was already receiving a compensation
higher than that prescribed therein, shall not suffer any decrease
in compensation. Furthermore, the minimum rates given here
shall be in ADDITION to the househelper’s lodging, food, and
medical attendance.

(3) Sick and Vacation Leaves

Re Mario B. Chanliongco
79 SCRA 364

If the husband is an employee, his unused leaves (whether
vacation or sick leaves) are regarded as conjugal, the same being
compensation for services rendered. They are, therefore, not
gratuities.

Recent legislation has caused an upward revision of the
minimum wage.
(3) Penalty

Art. 1419. When the law sets, or authorizes the setting of
a minimum wage for laborers, and a contract is agreed upon
by which a laborer accepts a lower wage, he shall be entitled
to recover the deficiency.

“Any employer who underpays an employee is liable to the
employee affected in the amount of the unpaid wages with legal
interest. Action to recover such liability may be maintained in
any competent court by any one or more employees on behalf of
himself or themselves. The court in such action shall in addition
to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a
reasonable attorney’s fee.”

of the state of necessity he found himself in (and
in case of a promise on his part not to repeat the
offense) dismissal would be a drastic punishment. The
dismissed employee should be reinstated, but without
backwages because his dismissal had been made in
good faith. The loss of wages from time of dismissal
to time of reinstatement, under the circumstances,
would be sufficient penalty (In this case, the time
interval was around three years).
(2)

Yes, the decision is subject to judicial review. It
is generally understood that as to administrative
agencies exercising quasi-judicial or legislative
power, there is an underlying power in the courts to
scrutinize the acts of such agencies on questions of law
and jurisprudence, even though no right of review is
given by statute. (73 C.J.S. 506, note 56) The purpose
of judicial review is to keep the administrative agency
within its jurisdiction and to protect the substantial
rights of the parties affected. This is part of the system
ofchecks and balances. Thus, the courts may declare
an administrative act illegal or corrupt or capricious.

Problem: As Ortigas Center-based law firm borrowed
P20 million from Neptali, an avid art collection at obviously
usurious interest. Can the creditor recover anything from
the debtor? Explain.
Answer: Yes, Neptali, the creditor, can recover the
principal together with legal interest thereon from the date
of demand (Art. 2209, Civil Code), and legal interest on the
interests paid in exams of the lawful rate from the payment
date. (Art. 1413, id.) Now, as to the usurious interest, such
cannot be recovered due to: a) Art. 1413 (Id.) and b) Sec. 6,
Usury Act.

The illegality, nonetheless, of the stipulation
concerning the usurious interests does not affect the

creditor’s right to recover the principle, inasmuch as
a contract of loan with usurious interest, is a divisible
contract. The illegal terms, followingAngel Jose v. Chelda,

GR 75197, June 22, 1987
FACTS: ERI is a corporation organized for the main
purpose of bidding for the contract to manage all the piers in
South Harbor, Manila. ER allegedly owned 100% equity. After
a public bidding, ERI was awarded in 1966 a five-year contract
to operate arrastre service at the South Harbor. In 1971, the
Bureau of Customs called for a new bidding. ERI secured an
injunction in the CFI (now RTC), but the Supreme Court ordered
the holding of a public bidding. ERI emerged as the Bidding
Committee's unanimous choice. A new contract for five years
881

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1422

effective 1974, renewable for another five years, was executed
between ERI and the Bureau of Customs. In 1978, ERI initiated
negotiations with Philippine Ports Authority, either for renewal
of contract for public bidding. The PPA manager did not act on
the request, due to the desire of people close to the President to
take over ERI.

its cancellation, benefit from its proceeds. The transfer of the
control of ERI from ER to the President’s brother-in-law, which
is null and void, served as the direct link to ERI’s obtaining the
management contract. Being the direct consequence and result
of a previous illegal contract, the Management Contract itself
is null and void as provided in Art. 1422.

Thereafter, ER, then owner of 93% of ERI’s equity was
allegedly coerced by emissaries from the President into indorsing
in blank ERI’s stock certificates covering 60% equity, and ER
did not get a single centavo for these shares. The party close to
the President was the latter’s brother-in-law. After the transfer,
a new group took control over ERI. ER was, however, retained
as company president. When the contract of ERI expired, it was
extended for a term of eight years beginning July, 1980.

On Feb. 26, 1986 after the ouster of the former government
administration, ER took active control. In July, 1986, the PPA
informed ERI that it was cancelling the management contract
and taking over the cargo handling operations. ERI and ER
contend that they were denied their right to due process when
PPA cancelled the Management Contract without prior hearing

and investigation.
HELD: The transfer of the shares of stock representing
60% equity to persons fronting for President Marcos’ brotherin-law was, at the very least, voidable for lack of consent, or
altogether void, being absolutely fictitious or simulated. The
invalidity springs not from vitiated consent nor absolute want
of monetary consideration, but for its having had an unlawful
cause that of obtaining a government contract in violation of
law.

—

While generally, the causa of the contract must not be
confused with the motives of the parties, this case squarely fits
into the exception that the motive may be regarded as causa
when it predetermines the purpose of the contract. On the part
of the President’s brother-in-law, the motive was to be able to
contract with the government which he was then prohibited
by law from doing. On ER’s part, to be able to renew his
management contract. Thus, by transferring 60% of the shares
in his company to the President’s brother-in-law, ER was able to
secure an eight-year contract with PPA and, for six years before

(2) ‘Voluntary Fulfillment’ Defined

TITLE III. — NATURAL OBLIGATIONS
(New, except Article 1427)

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
Comment of the Code Commission Re: Natural Obligations

In all the specific cases of natural obligations recognized
by the Civil Code, there is a moral duty, but not a legal duty to
perform or to pay, but the person thus performing or paying feels
that in good conscience, he should comply with his undertaking
which is based on moral grounds. Why should the law permit
him to change his mind, and recover what he has delivered or
paid? Is it not wiser and more just that the law should compel
him to abide by his honor and conscience? Equity, morality,
those are after all the abiding foundations
natural justice
of positive law. A broad policy justifies as a legal principle that
would encourage persons to fillfill their obligations. (Commission

—

Report, pp. 58-59)

Art. 1423. Obligations are civil or natural. Civil obligations
give a right of action to compel their performance. Natural
obligations, not being based on positive law but on equity and
natural law, do not grant a right of action to enforce their
performance, but after voluntary fulfillment by the obligor,
they authorize the retention of what has been delivered or
rendered by reason thereof. Some natural obligations are set
forth in the following articles.

COMMENT:
(1) Civil and Natural Obligations Distinguished

This Article distinguishes between civil and natural
obligations.
884

“Voluntary fulfillment” means that the debtor complied
with the same even if he knew that he could not have been legally
forced to do so. Thus, payment through a coercive process of
the wnt of execution issued at the instance and insistence of
the prevailing party, is NOT considered voluntary, and the
provisions of the law on natural obligations cannot be applied
thereto. (Manila Surety & Fidelity Co. v. Lim, GR L-9343, Dec.
29, 1959) In case of partial voluntary fulfillment, the balance
cannot be recovered, since on said balance, there has not yet
been created a legal obligation.
(3) Undue Payment Distinguished from Natural Obligation

If I pay a debt that has prescribed

—

(a)

not knowing it has prescribed, I can recover on the ground
of undue payment.

(b)

knowing it has prescribed, I cannot recover for this would
be a case of a natural obligation.
[NOTE: Payment through a coercive process of the
writ of execution issued at the instance and insistence of
the prevailing party, is NOT considered voluntary and
the provisions of the law on natural obligations, cannot be
applied thereto. (Manila Surety & Fidelity Co. v. Lim, GR
L-9343, Dec. 29, 1959)]

(4) No Juridical Tie in Moral Obligations

While there is a juridical tie in natural obligations, there is
none in moral obligations. Thus, giving a legal assistance to one’s
employee (who has been accused of a crime) is merely a moral
obligation, and the employee cannot recover attorney’s fee from
the employer. (De la Cruz v. Northern Theatrical Enterprises,
Inc., et al., 50 O.G. 4225, Sept. 1954)
Similarly, a Christmas bonus, not yet given to employees,
is not generally a demandable and enforceable obligation; nor
may it be considered a natural obligation for there has been no
voluntary performance as yet. The Courts cannot order therefore

Phil. 140)
Art. 1425. When without the knowledge or against the will

by the transaction. However, A later voluntarily reimburses C.
May A now recover what he has given to C?

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:

Comment of the Code Commission on Estoppel
“An important branch of American Law is estoppel. It is a
source of many rules which work out justice between the parties,
through the operation of the principle that an admission or
representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it,
and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying
thereon.” (Report of the Code Commission, p. 59)
Art. 1431. Through estoppel an admission or representation
is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot
be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon.

Void
If the will is void, the legacy would also be void and the
deceased is considered to have died without a will. This is the
reason for the existence of the Article.
(2) Example

In a will defective for lack of the needed legal formalities,
X, a friend, was given a legacy. The legacy is void, and the whole
estate should go to the intestate heirs. If however, the intestate
heirs give X the legacy, they cannot get it back now, provided
that the debts of the deceased have been settled.

By analogy, all alienations defective for lack of the proper

formalities may be included under Art. 1430.

COMMENT:
(1) Concept of Estoppel

“Speaking generally, it may be said that estoppel is a bar
which precluded a person from denying or asserting anything
contrary to that which has been, in contemplation of law,
established as the truth either by acts of judicial or legislative
officers, or by his own deed or representation either express or
implied.” (19 Am Jur 601)
[NOTE: In Lopez v. Ochoa, GR L-7955, May 30, 1958, the
Supreme Court held that waiver and estoppel are frequently
used as convertible terms. The doctrine of waiver belongs to the
family of, is of the nature of, is based on, estoppel. The essence
of waiver is estoppel, and where there is no estoppel, there is no
waiver. This is especially true where the waiver relied upon is
constructive or implied from the conduct of a party. Thus, when
it is asserted that a “party is in estoppel,” this is the same as
saying that said party had made a waiver.]

Royales v. Intermediate Appellate Court
GR L-65072, Jan. 31, 1984

If recourse to the barangay courts is not availed of, the
complaint may be dismissed for lack of a cause of action, unless
the requisite has been waived by failure to set up a timely
objection. The aggrieved person may be deemed to be in estoppel.
Ruperto Pureza v. Court of Appeals, Asia Trust
Development Bank and Spouses Bonifacio
& Crisanta Alejandro
GR 122053, May 15, 1998

A principle of equity and natural justice, the application
of the principle of estoppel is proper and timely in heading off
petitioner’s shrewd efforts at renouncing his previous acts to
the prejudice of parties who had dealt with him honestly and
in good faith.

In the case at bar, petitioner having performed affirmative
acts upon which the respondents based their subsequent actions,
cannot thereafter refute his acts or renege on the effects of the
same, to the prejudice of the latter. To allow him to do so would
be tantamount to conferring upon him the liberty to limit his
liability at his whim and caprice, which is against the very
principles of equity and natural justice as abovestated.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

barred from adopting an inconsistent position, attitude or course
of conduct that thereby causes loss or injury to another. It further
bars him from denying the truth of a fact which has, in the
contemplation of law, become settled by the acts and proceedings
of judicial or legislative officers or by the act of the party himself,
either by conventional writing or by representations, express or
implied of in pais.
(2) Origin of Estoppel

The doctrine of estoppel has its origin in equity, and is
based on moral rights and natural justice. Its applicability to any
particular case depends to a very large extent upon the special
circumstances of the case. (Mirasol v. Municipality ofTabaco,
43 Phil. 610)
(3) Examples of Estoppel
(a)

If a husband in a sworn declaration constituting a family
home has stated in said documents that he was married,
naming his wife, he cannot thereafter be heard to say that
he and the girl are not married. Therefore, the family home
should be considered as copjugal property. (Montoya v.
Ignacio, et al., GR L-10518, Nov. 29, 1957)

(b)

A holder of a promissory note given because of gambling
who indorses the same to an innocent holder for value and
who assures said party that the note has no legal defect,
is estopped from asserting that there had been an illegal
consideration for the note, and so, he has to pay its value.
(Rodriguez v. Martinez, 5 Phil. 67)

(c)

A person who alleged at one time in court that he was the
owner of a certain cabaret cannot afterwards deny his
ownership thereof. (Patricio v. Patricio, 78 Phil. 759)

(d)

A person claiming for his salary was selling his interest
in the stock of a corporation to said corporation. The
corporation refused to consider the sale unless the claim for
salary was omitted. So, the seller drew another contract,
this time with no mention of the salary. He cannot now
claim the salary in view of estoppel. (Herman v. Radio
Corporation of the Phil., 50 Phil. 490)

Adoracion E. Cruz, et al. v. Court of Appeals
and Sps. Eliseo & Virginia Malolos
GR 126713, July 27, 1998

FACTS: Petitioners, in their transactions with others,
have declared that the other lands covered by the Memorandum
of Agreement are absolutely owned, without indicating the
existence of a co-ownership over such properties.
ISSUE: Are petitioners estopped from claiming otherwise?

HELD: Yes, because the petitioners’ very own acts and
representations, as evidenced by the deeds of mortgage and
of sale, have denied such co-ownership. Under the principle of
estoppel, petitioners are barred from claiming co-ownership
of the lands in issue. In estoppel, a person, who by his deed or
conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner, is

(e)

A vendee a retro who at one time recognized ownership in
the subject matter by the vendor a retro cannot now claim
ownership over the same. (Matienzo and Palileo v. CFI of
Laguna, 64 Phil. 542)

(f)

“He who prevents a thing from being done may not
avail himself of the non-performance which he himself
has occasioned,” for the law says to him in effect, “this
is your own act, and therefore you are not damnified.”
Where, therefore, a taxpayer repeatedly requested for
reinvestigation of his case and therefore persuaded the
government to postpone collection of the tax, he cannot set
up prescription of the action. (Coll. v. Suyoc Consol, GR
L-11527, Nov. 25, 1958)

(g)

If the registered owner of a private or public vehicle sells
it to another, but does not cancel its registration under his
name, he will still be responsible if the buyer causes damage
or injury to another. He will be estopped from asserting
that the property had already been transferred by him to
another. The Motor Vehicle Law requires registration so
as to identify the owner in case of an accident or injury
on the highways. Responsibility is thus fixed on a definite
individual, the registered owner. If this were not the rule,
it would be very easy for the registered owner to escape
responsibility by simply transferring the property to an

indefinite person or to one who possesses no property with
which to respond financially for the damage or injury done.
However, the registered owner who has already conveyed
or transferred a vehicle has a right to be indemnified by
the vendee or transferee for the amount that he may be
required to pay as damages to the person injured by the
vehicle. (Erezo, et al. v. Jepte, GR L-9605, Sept. 30, 1957;
See Montoya v. Ignacio, GR L-5868, Dec. 29, 1953; Roque
v. Malibay Transit, GR L-8561, Nov. 18, 1955; and Vda.

A government employee who accepts the benefits accruing
from the abolition of his office is estopped from questioning
the validity of the abolition and is deemed to have waived
the right to contest the same. (Magana v. Agregado, et al.,

Fieldman’s Insurance Co., Inc. v.
Mercedes Vargas Vda. de Songco, et al.
GR L-24833, Sept. 23, 1968

FACTS: Federico Songco, a man of scant education
being only a first grader, owned a private jeepney, which
was covered by a common carrier's liability insurance by
the Fieldman’s Insurance Co. The contract was procured
by the company’s agent, who induced Federico to have
the vehicle insured, although it was NOT a COMMON
CARRIER, but a private one. In fact the 42-year-old son
of Federico had misgivings, for the vehicle was merely for
private use. The agent assured Federico, however, that
the contract was valid. Sometime later, the vehicle was
involved in a collision, resulting in death to Federico and
one of his sons, and physical injuries to two others. When
the surviving widow and other children sued the Company
under the terms of the contract, the latter alleged that the
same was not valid, for it was not a common carrier.
ISSUE: Is the Company liable?
HELD: Yes, the Company is liable on account of
estoppel. Moreover, the contract of insurance is one of
perfect good faith (uberrima fides) not for the insured alone,
but equally so for the insurer; in fact, it is more so for the
latter, since its dominant bargaining position carries with
it stricter responsibility. (See Qua Chee Gan v. La Union
& Rock Insurance Co., Ltd., 93 Phil. 85 [1955])

GR L-33794, May 31, 1982
If a party fails to object to the construction of an
electric substation within his property, and only asked
for assurance that the station would not be a nuisance or
dangerous, he can be said to be in “contractual estoppel.”
Pantranco v. Court of Ind. ReL
GR L-9736, May 20, 1957
(Instance Where Estoppel Does Not Apply)

FACTS: Under public service regulations, a public
service operator is not allowed to employ a person who has
895

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1431

been convicted of the crime of theft. Now, then, a certain
public service operator employed unknowingly such a
convict. May he now be allowed to dismiss said convict in
compliance with the regulations?
HELD: Yes, for estoppel should not apply. Otherwise,
two things may result. Firstly, the regulation may be
circumvented were we to apply estoppel. Secondly, we
would be unnecessarily punishing an employer despite his
desire to comply with the regulation upon his discovery
that a disqualification existed.

Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Luzon
Marine Dept. Union, et al.
101 Phil. 257
Estoppel by laches (unreasonable delay in making
a claim in court) does not apply to employees in claiming
overtime pay, for to allow estoppel in this case would
be to bring about a situation whereby the employee
or laborer, who cannot expressly renounce the right to
extra compensation under the law, may be compelled to
accomplish the same thing by mere silence or lapse of time,
thereby frustrating by indirection the purpose of the law.
However, laches may favor the inference that no such
overtime work had been made; or that, even if it existed,
it has already been duly compensated.
No estoppel can be invoked if the complaining party
has not been misled. (Cristobal v. Gomez, 50 Phil. 810)

If a public officer makes an erroneous application and
enforcement of the law, he is not considered in estoppel.
(Phil. Long Distance Tel. Co. v. Coll, of Int. Rev., 90 Phil.
674) However, other affirmative acts of officials may raise
estoppel against the government. (Bachrach Motor Co. v.
Unson, 50 Phil. 981; and Boada v. Posadas, 58 Phil. 184)
[NOTE: However, omission or neglect of government
officials does not create estoppel against the government.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1431

Social Security Commission v. Ponciano L.
Almeda and Eufemia P. Almeda
GR 75428, Dec. 14, 1988
When respondents negotiated for the reduction of the
attorney’s fees, they acquiesced to the stipulation therefor
and cannot now question its validity. It is undisputed
that respondents requested merely for a reduction of the
attorney’s fees. In Resolution 286, the Social Security

System (SSS) approved respondent’s request and reduced
the attorney’s fees from 20% to 15%. Respondents
thereafter paid without protest the total obligation,
including attorney’s fees equivalent to 15%. The claim of
respondent Ponciano Almeda that he verbally protested the
collection of attorney’s fees is belied by the abovecited SSS
Resolution which shows that Almeda merely requested the
reduction of attorney’s fees. Between Almeda’s testimony,
which is obviously self-serving, and the SSS Resolution,
which is a public document, the latter certainly carries
greater probative value. Clearly then, respondents were
indeed in estoppel.

Laurel v. Civil Service Commission
GR 71562, Oct. 28, 1991

FACTS: Petitioner did not raise the issue that
the position of Provincial Administrator is primarily
confidential. On the contrary, he submits that said
position is not primarily confidential, for it belongs to the
career service. He even emphasized this fact with an air
of absolute certainty. He changed his mind only after the
Civil Service ruled that the “prohibitive mantle on nepotism
would include designation, because what cannot be done
directly cannot be done indirectly” and, more specifically,
when he filed his motion to reconsider said resolution.

HELD: Per Art. 1431 of the Civil Code, through
estoppel, an admission or representation is rendered
conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied
or disproved as against the person relying thereon.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(i)

A petitioner cannot be estopped in questioning the validity
of a customer’s agreement and from denying the effects of
his conduct. (Lim v. Queensland Tokyo Commodities, Inc.,
GR 136031, Jan. 4, 2002)

Jefferson Lim v. Queensland Tokyo
Commodities, Inc.
GR 136031, Jan. 4, 2002
FACTS: Private respondent Queensland Tokyo
Commodities, Inc. (Queensland) is a duly-licensed broker
engaged in the trading of commodities futures with full
membership and with a floor trading right at the Manila
Futures Exchange, Inc. (MFEI).
Sometime in 1992, Benjamin Shia, a market analyst
and trader of Queensland, was introduced to petitioner
Jefferson Lim. Shia suggested that Lim invest in the
foreign exchange (forex) market, trading U.S. dollar
against the Japanese yen, British pound, Deutschemark,
and Swiss franc. Because respondent Queensland dealt
in pesos only, it had to convert $5,000 in manager’s check
to pesos, amounting to P125.000 since the exchange rate
at that time was P25 to $1. To accommodate petitioner’s
request to trade right away, it advanced the P125.000
from its own funds while waiting for the manager’s check
to clear. Thereafter, a deposit notice in the amount of
P125.000 was issued to Queensland, and which was sent
to Lim who received it. Then, Lim signed a customer’s
agreement. Soon thereafter, petitioner Lim was allowed to
trade with respondent company which was coursed through
Shia by virtue of the blank order forms. Meanwhile, on
October 22, 1992, respondent learned that it would take
17 days to clear the manager’s check given by petitioner.
Thereupon, respondent asked Shia to talk to petitioner
for a settlement of his account but petitioner refused to
talk with Shia. The latter made follow-ups for more than
a week beginning October 27, 1992. Owing to the fact
that petitioner disregarded this request, respondent was
compelled to engage the services of a lawyer, who sent a
demand letter to petitioner but which went unheeded.

Thus, respondent filed a complaint against petitioner, for

. dismissal

On April 22, 1994, the trial court ordered the
of the complaint as well as that of the defendant’s
counterclaim. On appeal by Queensland, the Court of
Appeals reversed and set aside the trial court’s decision.
ISSUE: Can petitioner be estopped in questioning
the validity of a customer's agreement and from denying
the effects of his conduct?

HELD: No. It is uncontested that petitioner had, in
fact, signed the customer’s agreement in the morning of
October 22, 1992, knowing fully well the nature of the
contract he was entering into. The customer’s agreement
was duly-notarized and as a public document it is evidence
of the fact, which gave rise to its execution and of the date
of the latter. (Sec. 23, Rule 132, Rules of Court) Next,
petitioner paid his investment deposit to respondent in
the form of a manager’s check in the amount of $5,000
as evidenced by PCI Bank Manager’s check 69007, dated
October 22, 1992. All these are indicia that petitioner
treated the customer’s agreement as a valid and binding

contract.

Clearly, by his own acts, petitioner is estopped from
impugning the validity of the customer’s agreement. For
a party to a contract cannot deny the validity thereof after
enjoying its benefits without outrage to one’s sense of
justice and fairness.

Principles of

Estoppel

The principles of estoppel are only suppletory.
(2) Pleading of Alleged Estoppel

(5) ‘Estoppel’ Does Not Apply against Government; Exception

The general rule is that the Government or State is never
estopped by the mistake or error of its agents (DBP v. COA, 823
SCRA 324 [2017]) absent any showing it had dealt capriciously
or dishonorably with its citizens. (Republic v. Susi, 814 SCRA
397 [2017])

While estoppel generally does not apply against govern¬
ment especially when the case involves the collection of taxes,
an exception can be made when the application of rule will cause
injustice against an innocent party. (Comm, of Internal Revenue
v. San Miguel Corp., 815 SCRA 563 [2017])

If facts are alleged as constituting estoppel, they must be
expressly pleaded. (CastaOeda v. Yap, 48 O.G. 3364)

Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc.
824 SCRA 327
(2017)

The Knights of Rizal (KOR) is now estopped from question¬
ing the construction of the Torre de Manila project. The KOR
itself came up with the idea to build a structure right behind
Rizal Monument that would dwarf said monument.

It is a basic principle that “one who seeks equity and justice
must come to court with clean hands.” The KOR, having earlier
proposed a national theater (a mere 286 meters in distance from
the back of the Rizal Monument that would have dwarfed the
said monument), had gone to the Supreme Court with uncleaned
hands.

Art. 1432. The principles of estoppel are hereby adopted,
insofar as they are not in conflict with the provisions of this
Code, the Code of Commerce, the Rules of Court and special
laws.

(a)

•

(b)

Definition: It arises when one, by his acts, representations
or admissions, or by his silence when he ought to speak
out, intentionally or through culpable negligence, induces
another to believe certain facts to exist, and such other
rightfully relies and acts on such belief, so that he will be
prejudiced if the former is permitted to deny the existence
of such facts. (31 Corpus Juris Secundum 237)

Carolina Liquete Ganzon v. Court of Appeals
GR 136831, July 30, 2002
Estoppel in pais, or equitable estoppel arises when
one, by his acts, representations or admissions or by
his silence when he ought to speak out, intentionally or
through culpable negligence, induces another to believe
certain facts to exist and such other rightfully relies and
acts on such belief so that he will be prejudiced if the
former is permitted to deny the existence of such facts. The
real office of the equitable norm of estoppel is limited to
supplying deficiency in the law, but it should not supplant
positive law.
In the case at bar, the requisites for the existence of
a tenancy relationship are explicit in the law and these
elements cannot be done away with by conjectures.
[NOTE: It takes place in a situation where because of
a party’s action or omission, he is denied the right to plead
or prove a fact otherwise important. (19 Am Jur 634)1

fraud may properly be a cause of action, on account of the
vitiated consent that it produces.]
Examples of estoppel in pais:
1)
If a vendee a retro agrees to accept a check in payment
of the repurchase price, he cannot afterwards allege
that the check is not legal tender. He is bound by his
own act. (Gutierrez v. Carpio, 53 Phil. 334)
2)
If the real owner of a house pretends to be merely
a broker in the sale thereof, he is estopped from
asserting ownership over the same. (Bachrach Motor
Co. v. Kane, 61 Phil. 504)
3)
If the NAMARCO has entered into a valid contract
with a certain Federation for the sale of certain
goods imported by the former, it (NAMARCO) cannot
question the validity of the transaction particularly
after it has received and accepted certain benefits
from the Federation as a result of the contract.
(NAMARCO v. Tan, et al., GR L-17074, March 31,
1964)

(c)

Some Doctrines
1)
Conduct because of ignorance or mistake does not
result in estoppel. (Ramiro v. Grano, 54 Phil. 744)
Indeed if someone was ignorant of the truth or was
mistaken, he cannot be said to be in estoppel. (Far
Eastern Surety Co. v. Court of Appeals, GR L-12019,
Oct. 16, 1958)
2)
Estoppel by laches (unreasonable delay in bringing
a court action, even if the period of prescription has
not yet lapsed) bars an action to create a vested right
(executory interest) but does not bar an action to

Nyco Sales Corp. v. BA Finance Corp.
GR 71694, Aug. 16, 1991

[NOTE: In Liguez v. Lopez, 102 Phil. 577, the
Supreme Court held that the rule of estoppel by laches
cannot apply to prevent enforcement of the principle
that a party to an illegal contract cannot recover what
he has given pursuant thereto, for the latter is a rule
of superior public policy.]

The lower court observed that there was
already a previous transaction of discounting of
checks involving the same personalities wherein any
enabling resolution from Nyco was dispensed with
and yet BA Finance was able to collect from Nyco and
Sanshell was able to discharge its own undertakings.
Such effectively places Nyco under estoppel in pais
which arises when one, by his acts, representation or
admissions, or by his silence when he sought to speak
out intentionally or through culpable negligence
induces another to believe certain facts to exist
and such other rightfully relies and acts upon such
belief, so that he will be prejudiced if the former is
permitted to deny the existence of such facts. Nyco
remained silent in the course of the transaction and
spoke out only later to escape liability. This cannot
be countenanced.

a)

conduct on the part of the defendant, or of
one under whom he claims, giving rise to the
situation of which the complaint is made and
for which the complaint seeks a remedy;

b)

delay in asserting the complainant’s rights, the
complainant having had knowledge or notice
of the defendant’s conduct and having been
afforded an opportunity to institute a suit;

lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the
defendant that the complainant would assert
the right on which he bases his suit;
d) injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event
relief is accorded to the complainant, or the suit
is not held to be barred, (see also Mejia de Lucas
v. Gamponia, 53 O.G. 667; see also Miguel v.
Catalina, GR L-23072, Nov. 29, 1968)]
Just because a person is silent does not necessarily
mean that he will be in estoppel. There should have
been a duty or obligation to speak. (19 Am Jur 663;
and Lora v. Del Rosario, et al., [CA.] 52 O.G. 268)
A mere promise to perform or to omit at some
future time does not necessarily result in estoppel

must have been relied upon, and prejudice would
result unless estoppel is applied. (See 19 Am Jur

that after the conveyance, they inform the vendee
of their minority is of no moment, because their
misrepresentation had already estopped them from
disavowing the contract. (Hermosa v. Zobel y Roxas,

(3) Estoppel BY DEED
(a)

Definition: It is a bar which precludes a party to a deed
and his privies from asserting as against the other and his
privies any right or title in derogation of the deed, or from
denying the truth of any material fact asserted in it. (31
CJS,p. 195)
[NOTE: There must be a written instrument.]

(b)

Examples of estoppel by deed:
1)
If several persons, each claiming ownership over
certain property deposited in a warehouse, in a
written document agree that it should be sold, said
persons cannot later on modify the terms of the
agreement. (Cu Unjieng v. Asia Banking Corporation,
45 Phil. 769)
2)

3)

(c)

If a shipper has his goods valued at only P200, he
cannot later on recover damages for its value more
than what he has declared in the bill of lading, even
if the value of the goods be worth much more, for he is
in estoppel. (Friexas and Co. v. Pacific Mail Steamship
Co., 42 Phil. 198)

Purchase in one’s own name with another’s money
generally gives title to the purchaser, that is, to him
who appears in the deed to have made the purchase

641; and Collector of Internal Revenue v. Favis, et al.,
GR L-11551, May 30, 1960)

Some Doctrines
1)

2)

If the deed or instrument is null and void because the
contract, let us say, is illegal, there is NO estoppel.
(17 Am Jur 605)
Ordinarily, the person estopped must be capacitated.
(19 Am Jur 604) But if a minor is clever enough to
deceive others, estoppel may result. (See Sia Suan
v. Alcantara, 47 O.G. 4561) Thus, minors who sell
real estate pretending, by the execution of a public
instrument, to have reached their majority, cannot
be permitted afterwards to excuse themselves from
906

Art. 1434

3)

If a person notarizes (and is not a party to) the
instrument, he is NOT in estoppel. (Borlasa v. Ramos,
GR L-3433, July 16, 1951)

Art. 1434. When a person who is not the owner of a thing
sells or alienates and delivers it, and later the seller or grantor
acquires title thereto, such title passes by operation of law to
the buyer or grantee.

COMMENT:
(1) Sale or Alienation by Non-owner
(a)

Example:

Jose sold in his own name Brigitte’s car to Gina. He
also delivered the car to Gina. If later on Brigitte donates
the car to Jose, ownership over the same passes to Gina,
not by tradition or delivery, but by operation of law.
(b)

In this kind of estoppel, prejudice is not essential. (Vda.
de Cruz u. Hagan, 46 O.G. No. 1, Supp. 352)

(c)

Article 1434 applies to the sale of “after-acquired property.”
This is allowed by the law on Sales under the Civil Code.

(2) Cases

Inquimboy v. Paez Vda. de Cruz
L- 13953, July 26, 1960

FACTS: Inquimboy sold a parcel of land to Albea in 1941,
who in turn, without having fully paid the price, sold the same
land to Cruz in 1943. The land was registered land, and when
Albea sold it to Cruz, the land was still registered in Inquimboy’s
name It was only in Feb. 1944 that the sale in favor of Albea
907

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1436

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1436-1437

was recorded. In May 1944, Albea’s title was cancelled and the
transfer certificate of title was issued to Cruz. Did Cruz really
acquire title over the property?

Art. 1436. A lessee or a bailee is estopped from asserting
title to the thing leased or received, as against the lessor or
bailor.

HELD: Yes, because although Albea was not yet the
registered owner at the time he sold it to Cruz, the fact remains
that he (Albea) subsequently acquired valid title in his own
name. This title was later transferred to Cruz. (See Art. 1434,

COMMENT:
(1) Estoppel on the Part of a Lessee or a Bailee

Civil Code)

(a)

Llacer v. Munoz de Bustillo and Achaval
12 Phil. 328

FACTS: At the time Llacer sold a piece of land to Munoz,
Llacer was not yet the owner thereof. Later, Llacer acquired
really the title over the land.
ISSUE: Is the sale to Mufioz valid?

HELD: Yes. Llacer’s subsequent acquisition of the land
has the effect of making his conveyance of the same to Mufioz
valid. (See Pang Lim and Galvez v. Lo Seng, 42 Phil. 282)
[NOTE: If, however, the deed of sale is alleged to be a
forgery, this is a question of fact that should be threshed out in
the trial court. (Felix Molina v. Court of Appeals and Manjon,
L-14524, Oct. 24, I960)]

Art. 1435. If a person in representation of another sells
or alienates a thing, the former cannot subsequently set up
his own title as against the buyer or grantee.

COMMENT:
(1) Sale or Alienation in Representation of Another

This is estoppel created in a representative capacity. In this
kind of estoppel, prejudice is also not essential. (Felix Molina v.
Court of Appeals and Manjon, L-14524, Oct. 24, 1960)
(2) Example

Amalia, in representation of Romeo, sells to Juanito a car.
Amalia cannot afterwards allege that she was really the owner
of the car, and that, therefore, the sale is not valid.
908

Under the Revised Rules of Court, one of the instances of
conclusive presumptions is in the case of the tenant, who is
not permitted to deny the title of his landlord at the time
of the commencement of the relation of landlord and tenant
between them. (Sec. 3-b, Rule 131; and Lizada v. Omanan,
59 Phil. 547)

Ordinarily, therefore, it is enough for the landlord to prove
the existence of the lease contract, for the presumption to
apply. (Pascual v. Angeles, 4 Phil. 604)
(c) Note that the law refers to a lessee or bailee (such as a
depository). (See Delgado v. Bonnevie, et al., 23 Phil. 308)
(d) The presumption has also been applied to a donee who
had accepted the donation in due form (Franco, et al. v.
Tutaan, [CA.] 50 O.G. 4317), as well as to a servant or
agent. (Barlin v. Ramirez, et al., 7 Phil. 41)
(b)

(2) When Presumption Does Not Apply

If the alleged tenant does not admit expressly or implicitly
the existence of the lease contract (such as when the landlord
did not attach or plead in his complaint the contract of lease),
the presumption does not apply. (Andres v. Judge Soriano, et
al., GR L-10311, June 29, 1957)

Art. 1437. When in a contract between third persons
concerning immovable property, one of them is misled by a
person with respect to the ownership or real right over the
real estate, the latter is precluded from asserting his legal title
or interest therein, provided all these requisites are present:
( 1) There must be fraudulent representation or wrongful
concealment of facts known to the party estopped;
(2) The party precluded must intend that the other
should act upon the facts as misrepresented;
909

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1437

The party misled must have been unaware of the
true facts; and
(4) The party defrauded must have acted in accordance
with the misrepresentation.
(3)

COMMENT:
(1) Estoppel Concerning Immovable Property

To apply this Article, one should have been misled,
otherwise there is no estoppel. (Fabie, et al. v. City of Manila,
10 Phil. 64; and Cristobal u. Gomez, 50 Phil. 810) Knowledge of
the true facts by the stranger prevents deception, so estoppel
cannot apply. (Vinluan v. Merrera, 92 Phil. 1077) On the part of
the party who is to be in estoppel, should have made a fraudulent
representation or wrongful concealment of facts known to him.
(Moller v. Sarile, GR L-7038, Aug. 31, 1955)
(2) Cases

Fabie, et al. v. City of Manila
10 Phil. 64

FACTS: Prior to his application for title, Fabie made a
plan where he mentioned a certain “estero” as the boundary of
his property, implying that it was not included in the estate.
Later, he submitted a formal application, this time including
the “estero” inside the estate. It was proved that the City of
Manila, to whom the application was submitted, never saw the
plan hereinabove referred to.
ISSUE: Is Fabie in estoppel?
1

HELD: No, for the City could not have been misled, since
its officials never saw the plan.

Cristobal v. Gomez
50 Phil. 810

FACTS: To misled others, two brothers, Epifanio and
Marcelino Gomez, drew up a plan whereby Epifanio, although
the registered owner of a parcel of land, admitted that Marcelino
was really the owner.
910

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1438

ISSUE: May Marcelino Gomez or his successors-ininterest claim ownership over the land by virtue of such written
admission by Epifanio?
HELD: No, because Marcelino was a party to the collusion,
and therefore, he could not have been misled. Had third parties
been misled, there would have been estoppel.
(3) Effect of Consent on the Part of the True Owner

Acquiescence by the true owner estops him from asserting
any right over the property. (Cementina, et al. v. Court of
Appeals, et al., 91 Phil. 922)

Cementina, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.
91 Phil. 922
FACTS: Ireneo and Isabel Cervantes owned conjugal land,
which was sold after Isabel’s death to Pablo Concepcion by
Ireneo, with his children’s consent. Later the children claimed
part of the property stating that the sale, insofar as it referred
to the portion inherited by them from their mother, Isabel,
should be considered void because Ireneo could not validly sell
the same.

HELD: The children are estopped from asserting their
rights in view of their acquiescence to the sale.
Art. 1438. One who has allowed another to assume
apparent ownership of personal property for the purpose
of making any transfer of it, cannot, if he received the sum
for which a pledge has been constituted, set up his own title
to defeat the pledge of the property, made by the other to a
pledgee who received the same in good faith and for value.

COMMENT:
(1) Allowing Someone to Assume Apparent Ownership of

Personal Property
(a)

This is estoppel that results from acceptance of benefits
(with knowledge of the true facts).
911

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1439

(b)

Example:

A has a diamond ring. He allowed B to assume
apparent ownership over the ring so that B might sell
the same. Instead, B pledged the ring with C to obtain a
loan. The money lent was later handed over to A. Later, A
attacks the validity of the pledge claiming that under the
law, the pledgee must be the owner thereof, and since B
in this case acted without authority, the pledge is invalid.
Is A allowed to do this?
ANS.: No, A is not allowed to do this. His receipt
of the sum for which the pledge was made is an implied
ratification of the pledge and A is, therefore, in estoppel.
(2) When Estoppel Applies Even If There Be No Benefits

Even if there be NO benefits, estoppel would also apply if
the “agent” was given apparent authority, and the other party
was misled into giving him credit. (Sly Cong Bieng v. Hongkong
& Shanghai Bank, 56 Phil. 598)
Art 1439. Estoppel is effective only as between the parties
thereto or their successors-in-interest.

COMMENT:
(1) Persons Bound by Estoppel

Both parties are, however, bound (Andres v. Pimentel, 21
Phil. 431) such as parties to a sale. (Borlaza v. Borgonio, GR
3433, July 16, 1951) Successors-in-interest (as well as privies
and grantees) are bound. (19 Am Jur 809) But third parties are

not.
(2) Estoppel on the Part of a Minor

A minor possessed of discretion and cleverness may be
bound by his own contract, even if entered into without parental
authority. (Sia Suan v. Alcantara, 47 O.G. 4561)
(3) Is the Government Bound by Estoppel?

Generally, the Government is not bound by estoppel,
particularly so if there has been an erroneous application and
912

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1439

enforcement of the law. (Phil. Long Distance Tel. Co. v. Coll, of
Int. Rev., 90 Phil. 674)

Examples:
(a)

In People v. Go, et al., GR L-11368-69, Oct. 30, 1959, the
Supreme Court held that the fact that the clerk of the
Supreme Court served notice upon the appellant that
its brief must be printed and filed with the Court within
45 days from receipt of notice does not and cannot confer
appellate jurisdiction upon said Court, where the appeal
was taken BEYOND the period prescribed by the Rides of
Court.

(b)

Any error made by a tax official in the assessment or
computation of taxes does NOT have the effect of relieving
the taxpayer from the full amount of liability as fixed by

law. Errors of tax officers do not bind the government or
prejudice its right to the taxes or dues collectible by it
from the citizen. (Lewin v. Galang, GR L-15253, Oct. 31,
1960; and Collector of Int. Rev. v. Ellen Wood McGrath,
GR L-12710, GR L-12721, Feb. 28, 1961) Estoppel cannot
operate against a court and it can therefore dismiss a case
anytime it discovers it has no jurisdiction. (Perez v. Perez,
L-14874, Sept. 30, 1960)
[NOTE: InNilo, etal. v. Romero, GR L-15195, March
29, 1961, it was however held that where the defendant
City was wrongly represented and its city attorney failed
to file a motion to dismiss based on such ground, estoppel
operates against said defendant City. The erroneous
designation of the representative when the defendant City
itself is namM, is NOT sufficient to set aside the proceeding
had in the case.]

Antonio Favis, et al. v. Municipality of Sabongan
GR L-26522, Feb. 27, 1969
ISSUE: Does estoppel apply against a Municipal
Corporation?

HELD: No. The doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied as
against a Municipal Corporation to validate a contract which it
has no authority to make

otherwise, it would be enabled to

Republic v. Caballero
79 SCRA 177

If a government official illegally conveys public land to

same.

law,
about the truth of which the other party is ignorant.
of
(Tanada and Macapagal v. Cuenco, et al., 100 Phil. 1101)

Abines v. BPI
482 SCRA 421 (2006)

Note here that the public policy considerations behind

fomm shopping are superior to that of a party's claim of estoppel.
(5) Estoppel by Record

The doctrine of estoppel by record only applies as between
the same parties or their privies and cannot be used against
strangers. If in two cases the plaintiffs be different but the
defendants are the same, the new plaintiffs are neither bound
by the first proceedings, nor may they take advantage of the
same. (Beltran, et al. v. Escudero, et al., 99 Phil. 643)
[NOTE: If party-litigant submit a case for decision without
objection they cannot claim, for the first time on appeal, that they
were deprived of the opportunity to submit additional evidence.
They are guilty of estoppel. (Baradi and Bonita v. Ignacio, et al.,
L-8324, Jan. 19, 1956, O.G. 5172)]
(6) Estoppel Cannot Validate a Void Contract

Prudential Bank v. Panis
GR 50008, Aug. 31, 1987
The doctrine of estoppel may not be invoked to validate a
void contract. As between parties to a contract, validity cannot
914

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1439

be given to it by estoppel if it is prohibited by law or is against
public policy. No citizen is competent to barter away what public
policy by law seeks to preserve.
(7) Promissory Estoppel

Mendoza v. Court of Appeals
GR 116710, June 25, 2001

FACTS: Petitioner obtained loans from a bank secured
by mortgages on several and personal properties. Since he
was having difficulty in meeting payments, he asked for
restructuring of the loans. He was told by the bank to submit
certain documents to determine if his request would be justified.
He said that the bank approved his proposal for restructuring.
For this purpose, he and his wife signed two blank promissory
note forms in the belief that said notes were to be filled out by
the bank to conform to a five-year restructuring program agreed
upon verbally. Instead of the five-year period, petitioner claimed
that the bank contravened their verbal agreement by affixing
dates on the two notes to make them mature in two, instead of
five years and inserting interest rates of 21% instead of 18% as
agreed upon. In a suit, petitioner filed for specific performance,
nullification of extrajudicial foreclosure of his mortgaged
property, and damages. He claimed that the bank had accepted
his proposals for restructuring.
The Regional Trial Court ordered the bank to restructure
to five years the loan of petitioner and to pay certain specified
damages. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and
ruled that there is no evidence of a promise that the bank had
accepted the proposals of petitioner for the restructuring of his
loans. It ruled further that petitioner’s communications were
mere proposals and the bank’s responses were not categorical
that petitioner’s request had been favorably accepted by the
bank.

ISSUE: Is petitioner correct in his argument that upon
submission of the required documents for restructuring his
proposed five-year restructuring plan was deemed automatically
approved by the bank?
916

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1439

HELD: The RTC’s ruling is based on the doctrine of
promissory estoppel enunciated in Ramos v. Central Bank, 41
SCRA 565. This doctrine may arise from the making of a promise,
even though without consideration, if it was intended that the
promise should be relied upon, and if a refusal to enforce it would
be virtually to sanction the perpetration of fraud or would result
in other injustice. Reliance by promissee is generally evidenced
by action or forbearance on his part, and the idea has been
expressed that such action or forbearance would reasonably
have been expected by the promissor.
With the doctrine serving as an exception to the general
rule that a promise of future conduct does not constitute estoppel,
certain elements, however, have to be established so as to be
entitled to its benefit: (a) a promise reasonably expected to
induce action or forbearance; (b) such promise did, in fact, induce
action or forbearance; and (c) the party suffered a detriment as
a result. Clearly, then, the doctrine presupposes the existence of
a promise on the part of one against whom estoppel is claimed.
The promise must be plain and unambiguous and sufficiently
specific so that the judiciary can understand the obligations
assumed and enforce the promise according to its terms.
In the case at bar, the petitioner failed to prove that the
bank had promised to approve the plan in exchange for the
submission of the proposal. Because no such promise was proven,
the doctrine does not apply.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1439

3.

relying upon said representation, a third person has
changed his position to his detriment.
An agency by estoppel, which is similar to the “doctrine
of apparent authority,” requires proof of reliance upon the
representations, and that, in turn, needs proof that the
representations predated the action taken in reliance.
(9) ‘Collateral Estoppel’

Philtranco Service Enterprises, Inc. v. Cual
831 SCRA 202
(2017)

The Labor Arbiter's decision in the first National Labor
Relations Commission (NLRC) case, finding Philtranco’s re¬
trenchment program to be illegal, constitutes res judicata in

the concept of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion.

(8) Concept of an ‘Agency by Estoppel’

Litonjua, Jr. v. Eternit Corp.
490 SCRA 204
(2006)

For an 'agency by estoppel' to exist, the following must be
established:
1. the principal manifested a representation of the
agent’s authority or knowingly allowed the agent to
assume such authority; or
2.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
(1) Trust’ Defined

It is the right to the beneficial enjoyment of property, the
legal title to which is vested in another. (65 C.J. 212)
(b) It is a fiduciary relationship concerning property which
obliges the person holding it to deal with the property for
the benefit of another. (Pacheco v. Arro, 85 Phil. 505) The
person holding, in view of his equitable title, is allowed to
exercise certain powers belonging to the owner of the legal
title. (54 Am Jur 21)
(a)

Gelano v. Court of Appeals
GR L-39050, Feb. 24, 1981
The word "trustee” as used in the corporation statute must
be understood in the general concept, and may include the
attorney prosecuting the case filed by the Corporation.
(2) Characteristics of a Trust’

It is a fiduciary relationship. (Pacheco v. Arro, 85 Phil. 505)
(b) Created by law or by agreement. (Art. 1441, Civil Code)
(c) Where the legal title is held by one, and the equitable title
or beneficial title is held by another. (65 C.J. 212)

(a)

A trust may exist because of a legal provision or because
of an agreement; a stipulation pour autrui can arise only
in the case of contracts.

(b)

A trust refers to specific property; a stipulation pour autrui
refers to specific property or to other things.

(5) Co-Ownership as a Trust’

Sotto v. Teves
GR L-38010, Oct. 31, 1978

A co-ownership is a form of trust, with each co-owner being
a trustee for each of the others.
(6) Beneficial Enjoyment on Interest

Chu, Jr. v. Caparas
696 SCRA 324

A trust by operation of law is the right to the beneficial
enjoyment of a property where legal title is tested in another.

QUERY
Why does a trust arise in favor of one who pays the purchase
price of a property in the name of another?

ANS.: This is because of the presumption that he who pays
for a thing intends a beneficial interest for himself. (Sime Darby
Phils., Inc. v. Mendoza, 699 SCRA 290)

(3) Trust* Distinguished from ‘Guardianship’or‘Executorship’

In a trust, the trustee or holder has LEGAL TITLE to the
property; a guardian, administrator, or executor does not have.

A trust fund refers to money or property set aside as a
trust for the benefit of another and held by a trustee. (Gership
Association, Inc. v. GSIS, 707 SCRA 481) A banking product
meant to attract clients due to reasonable profit yields is the

Gelano v. Court of Appeals
GR L-39050, Feb. 24, 1981

A lawyer who has been defending the interest of a
corporation may, in the case of a litigation in court still pending
after the expiration of the three-year period after dissolution, still
continue as TRUSTEE of the corporation at least with respect to
the matter in litigation. This would be in substantial compliance
with the Corporation Code which allows the conveyance of the
properties of a corporation to a trustee to enable it to prosecute
and defend suits by or against the corporation beyond the threeyear period.

73 SCAD 606

EXPRESS TRUSTS
Art. 1443. No express trusts concerning an immovable or
any interest therein may be proved by parol evidence.

COMMENT:
(1) Formalities Re Express Trusts

The law says that “no express trusts concerning an
immovable or any interest therein may be proved by parol (oral)
evidence.”
Therefore:

(1996)

The so-called adversary positions of the parties had no
effect on the trust as it never changed the position of the parties
in relation to each other and to the dollar proceeds.
The Loss and Subrogation Receipt did not exculpate
petitioner from its liability for the accrued interest as this
obligation arose in connection with its role as trustee. The
signing of said receipt was a valid pre-condition before petitioner
could be compelled to turn over the whole amount of the
insurance to the two insured. It is grossly unfair for anyone to
earn income on the money of another and still refuse to share
any part of that income with the latter.

(a)

the requirement that the express trust be written is only for
enforceability, not for validity between the parties. Hence,
this Article may by analogy be included under the Statute
of Frauds. (See Gamboa v. Gamboa, 52 Phil. 503)

(b)

By implication, for a trust over personal property an oral
agreement is valid and enforceable between the parties.

(c)

Regarding third persons, the trust must be: in a public
instrument and REGISTERED in the Registry of Property,
if it concerns REAL PROPERTY.

(2) Distinguished from the Formalities of an Implied Trust

An implied trust (whether real or personal property is
involved) may be proved by oral evidence. (Art. 1457, Civil Code)

The present case was instituted by the creditor to declare
him owner of the land, and to fix the period for the delivery of
the land to him. A motion to dismiss was filed on the ground of
prescription, more than ten years having elapsed.

ISSUE: Has the action by the creditor prescribed?
HELD: No, the action has not prescribed.
(a) In the first place, the case involves an express trust. Under
Art. 1444 of the Civil Code, no particular words are needed
for the creation of an express trust. In this case the naked
ownership of the land passed to the creditor, while the
usufruct remained with the children of the deceased affiant
for an undetermined period of time. The children are
deemed to have held the land as trustees of the creditor.
In view of the creation of the express trust, it is clear that
no period of prescription is involved, the recovery being
imprescriptible.

the defendants, and permitted the latter to occupy and take
possession of the property when the tenant disoccupied it,
such acts should be construed as a recognition of the fact
that the property, though still in the former’s name, was
to be held in trust for the defendant, to be conveyed to him
on payment of the purchase price, and such trust is an

EXPRESS one.]

(b)

Julio v. Dalandan
GR L-19012, Oct. 20, 1967

FACTS: The deceased father of the defendants
executed on Sept. 8, 1950 an affidavit attesting to the
following facts:

"

.

(a)

that he owed someone a sum of money;

(b)

that as security thereof, he gave a parcel of land to
the creditor,

(c)

that in view of his failure to pay the debt, the mortgage
was foreclosed;

(d)

that he felt bound by such foreclosure;

(e)

that he therefore promises to replace said land by
another lot or farm of approximately the same area
on the condition that his children should not be forced
to give the harvest, and on the further condition that
substitution should not be required immediately.

,

.

This promise was accepted by the creditor.
924

Art. 1444

In the second place, assuming that there is no trust involved
in this case, the period of prescription is, under the facts,
a term of 30 years.

Observations on the Julio v. Dalandan case:
(a)

It is doubtful whether a trust was intended in this case.
While it is true that no particular words are needed for
the creation of an express trust, still there must be an
INTENT to create a fiduciary relationship with respect to
the property. No such relationship was contemplated in
this case.

(b)

Indeed, if it is true that the naked ownership was
immediately transferred to the creditor, and the children
were the usufructuaries, it is the creditor who would be
the trustee and the children would be the usufructuary
beneficiaries or the cestui que trust not the other way

—

around.
(c)

—

It is impossible to regard the creditor as the naked owner,
for the affidavit (which was conformed to by the creditor)
clearly stipulated that the substitution (of the land for the
debt) would not be required immediately.
925

Art. 1444

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(d)

The alleged “substitution” was really in the form of a dation
in payment or assignment to take place in the future.
Therefore, to determine whether the creditor’s right had
already prescribed, what the court should have done was
to first fix a period for the transfer of the property. Later,
the court could determine if more than ten years (not 30
years) had elapsed from the date the transfer should have
been done. (See Art. 1144 of the Civil Code)

(2) Clear Intent

There must be a CLEAR INTENTION to create a trust.
(Thus, no particular or technical words are required.) (Lorenzo

v. Posadas, 64 Phil. 353)
(3) Capacity

(a)

(b)
(c)

The trustor must be capacitated to convey property. [Hence,
it has been held that a minor cannot create an express or
conventional trust of any kind. (Gayondato v. Treasurer,
49 Phil. 244) However, a joint owner of a thing may be a
trustor and the other a trustee of one’s share. (Lavadi u.
De Mendoza, 72 Phil. 186)]

The trustee must be capacitated to hold property and to
enter into contracts.
The beneficiary must be capacitated to receive gratuitously
from the trustor. (Therefore, if he is incapacitated to be
the trustor’s donee, heir or legatee, or devisee, he cannot
become a beneficiary of a gratuitous trust.)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1446

as long as they are legal and possible. (Sec. 6[b], Rules 98,
Rules of Court)
(d)

The trustee must render a true and clear account. (Sec.
6[c], Rule 98, Rules of Court)

(e)

The trustee cannot acquire the property held in trust
by prescription as long as the trust is admitted. (If he
repudiates, and this is made known to the party involved,
prescription is permitted). (See Bancairen v. Diones, 98
Phil. 122)
[NOTE: In Escobar v. Locsin, 74 Phil. 86, the Court
had occasion to rule that a trust is sacred and inviolable,
and the courts should therefore shield fiduciary relations
against every manner of chicanery.]
QUERY: May a trustee of a trust estate be personally
liable?

HELD: In the absence of an express stipulation in a
contract entered into by a trustee for a corporation that
the trust estate and not the trustee should be liable on the

contract, the trustee is liable in its individual capacity. (Tan
Senguan & Co. v. Phil. Trust Co., 58 Phil. 700)

QUERY: When may a trustee sue as such?

HELD: Before a trustee may sue or be sued alone
as such, it is essential that his trust be EXPRESS, that
is, a trust created by the direct and positive acts of the
parties, by some writing, deed, or will or by proceedings
in court. (Philippine Air Lines, Inc. v. Heald Lumber Co.,
GR L-11479, Aug. 1957)

(4) Administration of the Trust
(a)

The trustee must file a bond. (Sec. 5, Rule 98, Rules of
Court)

(b)

The trustee must make an inventory of the real and
personal property in trust. (Sec. 6[a], Rule 98, Rules of
Court)

(c)

The trustee must manage and dispose of the estate and
faithfully discharge his trust in relation thereto, according
to law or according to the terms of the trust instrument
926

Art. 1445. No trust shall fail because the trustee appointed
declines the designation, unless the contrary should appear
in the instrument constituting the trust.

COMMENT:
Effect If Trustee Declines

The trust ordinarily continues even if the trustee declines.
Reason the court will appoint a new trustee, unless otherwise

provided for in the trust instrument. (Sec. 3, Rule 98, Rules of
Court) A new trustee has to be appointed, otherwise the trust
will not exist. (65 C.J. 233)
[NOTE: As between the mother and the uncle of a minor,
the former ought to be preferred as trustee of the proceeds of an
insurance policy of the deceased father in the absence of evidence
that would reveal the incompetence of the mother. (Cabanas v.
Pilapil, GR L-25843, July 25, 1974)]

Art. 1446. Acceptance by the beneficiary is necessary.
Nevertheless, if the trust imposes no onerous condition upon
the beneficiary, his acceptance shall be presumed, if there is
no proof to the contrary.

COMMENT:
(1) Necessity of Acceptance by the Beneficiary

For the trust to be effective, the beneficiary must accept:
(a)

expressly, or

(b)

impliedly, or

(c)

presumably.

(3) How Express Trusts

Are ENDED

(a)

Mutual agreement by all the parties

(d)

Rescission or annulment (as in other contracts)
(e) Loss of subject matter of
the trust (physical loss or legal
impossibility)
(f) Order of the court (as when
the purpose of the trust is

(g)

(h)

Accomplishment of the purpose of the trust
[NOTE: A testamentary trust for
the administration
and eventual sale of certain properties of the testator
not at the time the trustee’s petition for the sale ofends
property is approved by the court, but at the time the
said
sale is actually made and the proceeds thereof distributed
to the proper recipients. (Trusteeship of Estate of Benigno
Diaz, L-1011, Aug. 31, I960)]

(2) When Acceptance Is Presumed

If the granting of benefit is PURELY GRATUITOUS
(no onerous condition), the acceptance by the beneficiary is

presumed.

Exception: If there is proof that he really did NOT accept.
[NOTE: Acceptance by the beneficiary of a gratuitous
trust is NOT subject to the rules for the formalities of donations.
Therefore, even if real property is involved, acceptance by the
beneficiary need not be in a public instrument. (Cristobal v.
Gomez, 50 Phil. 810) Here, the court held that mere acquiescence
in the formation of the trust, and acceptance under the second
paragraph of Art. 1311 ( regarding a stipulation pour autrui) are

sufficient.]

IMPLIED TRUSTS
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
Comment of the Code Commission
The doctrine of implied trust is founded on equity. The
principle is applied in the American legal system to numerous
cases where an injustice would result if the legal estate or title
were to prevail over the equitable right of the beneficiary. (Com.
Report, p. 60) Even though there has been no fraud or immorality
involved, still there is a mutual antagonism between the trustee
and the beneficiary. (65 C.J. 222) Fair dealing demands the
establishment of the relation. (Dixon v. Dixon, 124 A. 198)

Art. 1447. The enumeration of the following cases of
implied trust does not exclude others established by the
general law of trust, but the limitation laid down in Article
1442 shall be applicable.

COMMENT:
(1) Enumeration of Instances of Implied Trust

The enumeration is not exclusive. But trusts are recognized
only if not in conflict with:
(a)

the Civil Code,

(b)

the Code of Commerce,

(c)

the Rules of Court,

(d)

Special Laws.

930

The City of Manila only holds in trust, for the National
Government, lands reserved for communal or community
property. Therefore, if the national government decides to sell

the parcels of land to their occupants, it cannot be said that the
City of Manila is being deprived of property without due process
of law.

Victorias v. Leuenberger and Court of Appeals
GR 31189, March 31, 1989

FACTS: In 1934, SG, the administratrix of the property
left by her husband and of the conjugal partnership property,
sold Lot A and Lot B, a 4-hectare portion of Lot 140, to the
Municipality of Victorias. Said municipality used this lot
as cemetery. Unfortunately, Victorias failed to register the
deed of sale. When SG died in 1942, NL, the granddaughter
claimed to have inherited the land from the former. In 1963,
she had the property relocated and registered in her name.
But the municipality prevented her from cultivating a portion
of the lot, Lots A and B, because the same had been sold to the
municipality. So, NL sued the municipality to recover the portion
occupied by the latter.

HELD: As registered owner, NL is entitled to the
protection afforded to a holder of a Torrens Title. Under the
Torrens system, every person receiving a certificate of title in
pursuance of a decree of registration shall hold the same free of

all encumbrances except those noted in said certificate. (Sec. 39,
Art. 496, now Sec. 43, PD 1529) In the instant case, however, NL
admitted that she inherited the land from her grandmother, who
had already sold the land to the municipality in 1934. Hence,
she merely stepped into the shoes of her grandmother and she
cannot claim a better right than her predecessor-in-interest.
When she applied for registration of the disputed land, she had
no legal right to do so as she had no ownership of the land since
land registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership but only
of confirming ownership of the land.
931

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1446

The Torrens system was not established as a means for
the acquisition of title to private land. It is intended merely to
confirm and register the title which one may already have on
the land. Where the applicant possesses no title or ownership
over the parcel of land, he cannot acquire one under the Torrens
system of registration. While an inherently defective Torrens
Title may not ordinarily be cancelled even after proof of its defect,
the law nevertheless safeguards the rightful party’s interest in
the titled land from fraud and improper use of technicalities
by allowing such party, in appropriate cases, to judicially seek
reconveyance to him of whatever he has been deprived of as long
as the land has not been transferred or conveyed to a purchaser
in good faith.
The land in dispute is held by NL in trust for the Municipality
of Victorias, which can neither be deprived of its possession nor
be made to pay rentals on it. NL is, in equity, bound to reconvey
the land to the cestui que trust, the Municipality of Victorias.
The Torrens system was never calculated to foment betrayal in
the performance of a trust.
(3) An Action for Reconveyance

In Aboitiz v. Po(825 SCRA 457(2017]), an action for recon¬
veyance based on an implied trust seeks to compel the registered
owner to transfer the property to the true owner.
When said act is done on the basis of an implied or con¬
structive trust, the prescriptive period is 10 years, or it is impre¬
scriptible if the movant is in the actual, continuous, and peaceful
possession of the property involved. Upon the other hand, when
the action for reconveyance is made by a void deed or contract,
the action is imprescriptible under Art. 1410 of the Civil Code.
(Yu Hwa Ping v. Ayala Land, Inc., 832 SCRA 427(2017])
Art. 1448. There is an implied trust when property is
sold, and the legal estate is granted to one party but the price
is paid by another for the purpose of having the beneficial
interest of the property. The former is the trustee, while the
latter is the beneficiary. However, if the person to whom the
title is conveyed is a child, legitimate or illegitimate, of the
932

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1448

one paying the price of the sale, no trust is implied by law, it
being disputably presumed that there is a gift in favor of the

child.

COMMENT:
(1) Purchase of Property Where Title Is Not Given to Payer

but to Another

(a)

This is a resulting trust (because a trust is intended).

(b)

Reason: One who pays for something usually does so for his
own benefit. (See Uy Aloe v. Cho Jan Jing, 19 Phil. 202)

(c)

Example of the Article: A buys a piece of land from B. A pays
the price so that he (A) may have the beneficial interest in
the land BUT the legal title is given to C. C is the trustee
and A is the beneficiary.
Suppose in the preceding example C was the
legitimate or illegitimate child of A, is an implied trust
still presumed in this case?

ANS.: No. Here, no trust is implied by law, it being
disputably presumed that there is a gift in favor of the
child. (1st sentence, Art. 1448)
[NOTE: It would seem that inasmuch as a
presumption (re the existence of a donation) has been made
by law, the formalities of a donation (indicated in Arts. 748
and 749 of the Civil Code) are NOT REQUIRED, for if the
formalities are to be still complied with, there would be no
need for the presumption.]
(2) Rule If Document Expresses a Different Intent

There is no implied trust if the document expresses a
different intention.
Example:

A paid the money for the purchase of land, but title was
given to B. It was proved that A paid because A was lending the
amount to B. (Armstrong v. Black, 46 Ariz. 507)

COMMENT:

(3) Case

Dico, Sr. v. Vizcaya Mgt. Corp.
701 SCRA 367

The person obtaining property through mistake or fraud
is considered by force of law a trustee of an implied trust for the
benefit of the person from whom the property comes.
(4) Instance of an Implied Trust

Bautista v. Bautista
820 SCRA 40
(2017)

An implied trust lies when a property is sold and the legal
estate is granted to one party but the price is paid by another
for the purpose of having the beneficial interest of the property.

Art. 1449. There is also an implied trust when a donation
is made to a person but it appears that although the legal
estate is transmitted to the donee, he nevertheless is either
to have no beneficial interest or only a part thereof.

(1) Conveyance of Property So That It May Serve as Security

This is a “constructive trust,” the reason of the law being
to prevent unjust enrichment.
(b) Example:

(a)

Jose wants to buy a piece of land from Pedro, but Jose
has no money. So Jose asks Carlos to pay for the land. The
land is then given in Carlos’ name. This is supposed to
be Carlos’ security until the debt of Jose is paid. Here an
implied trust has been created. Carlos is only a trustee, the
beneficiary being Jose. When Jose has the money, he may
redeem the property from Carlos and compel a conveyance
thereof to him (Jose). The trust here is implied, hence
it exists even if in the title taken by Carlos, there is no
mention of the interest of Jose or of his right to redeem.
[NOTE: Do not confuse the above example with the case;
Jose borrows money from Carlos, and Jose later buys land in his
own name. Jose then executes a mortgage on the land in favor
of Carlos. This is NOT an implied trust. It is clearly a case of

MORTGAGE.]

COMMENT:
When Donee Does Not Get Full Ownership of Benefit
This is again a “resulting trust,” where the “donee” becomes
the trustee of the real beneficiary.
Example:
A donated land to B. But it was agreed that B is supposed
to have only one-third of the products of said land. There is a
trust here, with B as the trustee.

Art. 1450. If the price of a sale of property is loaned or paid
by one person for the benefit of another and the conveyance
is made to the lender or payor to secure the payment of the
debt, a trust arises by operation of law in favor of the person
to whom the money is loaned or for whom it is paid. The latter
may redeem the property and compel a conveyance thereof
to him.
934

Carantes v. Court of Appeals
76 SCRA 514

No fiduciary relationship exists between the so-called
“trustor” and the so-called “trustee” in a constructive trust.
(2) Trust Receipt

In connection with Art. 1450, mention may be made of
what was referred to in Phil. Nat. Bank v. Vda. y Hijos de Angel
Jose, 63 Phil. 814, as a “trust receipt.” The Court said: “A trust
receipt, as a contract, partakes of the nature of a conditional
sale the importer becoming the absolute owner of the imported
merchandise as soon as he has paid its price; until the owner or
the person who advanced payment has been paid in full, or if the
merchandise has already been sold, the proceeds turned over to
him, the ownership continues to be vested in such person."
935

Art. 1460

(3) ‘Trust Receipt’ Defined

A trust receipt is a security transaction intended to aid in
financing importers and retail dealers who do not have sufficient
funds or resources to finance the importation or purchase of
merchandise, and who may not be able to acquire credit except
through utilization, as collateral, of the merchandise imported
or purchased. (South City Homes, Inc., Fortune Motors [Phils.],
Palawan Lumber Manufacturing Corp. v. BA Finance Corp., GR
135462, Dec. 7, 2001)
(4) Case

Art. 1451

such as a third party claim or a separate civil actions which it
deems best to protect its right, at any time upon default or failure
of the entrustee to comply with any of the terms and conditions
of the trust agreement. (Ibid.)

Art. 1451. When land passes by succession to any person
and he causes the legal title to be put in the name of another,
a trust is established by implication of law for the benefit of
the true owner.
COMMENT:
(1) When Title to Inherited Land Is Not in Owner’s Name

South City Homes, Inc., Fortune Motors (Phils.),
Palawan Lumber Manufacturing Corp. v.
BA Finance Corp.
GR 135462, Dec. 7, 2001
*

FACTS: Petitioners posit that as an entruster, respondent
BA Finance Corp, must first demand the return of the unsold
vehicles form Fortune Motors Corp. (FMC), pursuant to the
terms of the trust receipts.

HELD: Having failed to do so, petitioners had no cause of
action whatsoever against FMC and the action for collection of

sum of money was, therefore, premature.
(5) Default or Failure of Entrustee to Comply with Terms of

Trust Agreement: Cancellation of Trust Not Absolutely
Necessary

In the event of default by the entrustee on his obligations
under a trust receipt agreement, it is not absolutely necessary
that the entruster cancel the trust and take possession of
the goods to be able to enforce his rights thereunder. (South
City Homes, Inc., Fortune Motor [Phils.], Palawan Lumber
Manufacturing Corp. v. BA Finance Corp., GR 135462, Dec. 7,
2001)

Significantly the law (PD 115) uses the word “may” in
granting to the entruster the right to cancel the trust and
take possession of the goods. Consequently, petitioner has the
discretion to avail of such right or seek any alternative action,
936

(a)

This is a ‘resulting trust,” for a trust is intended.

(b)

Example: A inherited a piece of land from his father, but A
caused the legal title to be put in the name ofX, a brother.
Here a trust is impliedly established, withX as trustee and
A as the beneficiary.

(2) Rule in Co-Ownership

If a co-owner or co-heir possesses certain property owned
in common by him and others, he is under the same situation
as a trustee insofar as the shares of the other co-owners are
concerned. (Bargayo v. Camumot, 40 Phil. 857)

Mariano v. Judge De Vera
GR 59974, March 9, 1987

FACTS: H and W owned, as conjugal property, during
their lifetime, 29 parcels of unregistered land. W died intestate
in 1903 and without debts. She left her husband H, and their
two legitimate children M and G as her only forced heirs. In
1952, H died also intestate and without debts, leaving as his
only compulsory heirs the children of G who, together with her
sister M, had predeceased their father and his (H’s) legitimate
children with his second wife.

In 1981 or 29 years after H’s death, the children of G
(grandchildren of H) sued the children of H (begotten of the
second wife) for partition. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants
937

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1451

had taken possession of the whole conjugal property and
appropriated to themselves (to the exclusion of plaintiffs) the
products of said property. On motion of defendants, the trial
judge dismissed the complaint saying that the right of action to
enforce an implied or constructive trust prescribes in ten years.

HELD: The order of the trial court dismissing the complaint
on the ground of prescription under Sec. 40 of Act 190 is wrong.
This case is governed by the rules on co-ownership, since
the parties are co-owners of the disputed properties, having
inherited the same from a common ancestor. The existence of
co-ownership argues against the theory of implied trust. Since
defendants had not clearly repudiated the co-ownership, nor had
they communicated such repudiation, if any, to plaintiffs, the
former cannot acquire the shares of the latter by prescription.
(3) Paraphernal Properties Registered under the Husband’s

Name
If properties inherited by a wife are registered under the
husband’s name, she can claim them as her own upon his death
even if she does not refer to the situation as a trust. Reason: Here
clearly a trust was intended. In Severino u. Severino, 44 Phil.
343, it was clearly ruled that the registration of property in the
name of one who holds in a trust character does not extinguish
the trust or destroy the rights of the beneficiary.
(4) Title in the Name of the Surviving Husband

In Flores v. Flores, 48 Phil. 288, it was held that “as long
as the surviving husband retains the property of the copjugal
estate itself, or its place, if sold, he holds it in the character of
administrator and is virtually a trustee (except with reference
to his share) for those interested in the conjugal partnership.
Nor does the obtaining of a Torrens Title in any way change the
situation.”
(5) Right of Co-heirs

In Castro v. Castro, 57 Phil. 675, the Supreme Court
observed that: “One who acquires a Torrens Title in his own
name to property which he is administering for himself and his
938

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arte. 1452-1453

brother and sisters as heirs from a common ancestor, and in
common descent, may be compelled to surrender to each of his

co-heirs his appropriate share; and a proceeding for partition is
an appropriate remedy by which to enforce this right.”

Art. 1452. If two or more persons agree to purchase
property and by common consent the legal title is taken in the
name of one of them for the benefit of all, a trust is created by
force of law in favor of the others in proportion to the interest
of each.

Uy Aloe v. Cho Jan Jing
19 Phil. 202

FACTS: Some Chinese merchants bought a lot with a house
on it so that the same could be used as their clubhouse. The
property was registered under the name of only one of them. The
registered owner leased the property, collected rents therefor,
and when asked for an accounting, refused to so account on the
ground that he was the owner thereof.
HELD: He is a mere trustee, and is therefore obliged to
render proper accounting. The beneficiaries are all the members
of the club.
(2) Presumption That Shares Are Equal

The shares or interest of co-owners are presumed to be
equal. (Art. 485, 2nd par., Civil Code)

Art. 1453. When property is conveyed to a person in
reliance upon his declared intention to hold it for, or transfer
it to another or the grantor, there is an unplied trust in favor

when it becomes due, he may demand the reconveyance of

Heirs of Emilio Candelaria v. Lucia Romero, et al.
L-12149, Sept. 30, 1960

FACTS: Two brothers, Emilio and Lucas Candelaria, each
purchased a lot on installment. Due to his inability to pay, Lucas
sold his interest therein to Emilio, who continued payment of
Lucas’ lot in the name of Lucas until the entire price was paid,
with the understanding that the necessary documents would be
made later. In 1918, a Transfer Certificate ofTitle for the lot was
issued in the name of Lucas. Lucas and his heirs acknowledged
the fact that they held the title merely in trust for Emilio. In
1956, Emilio’s heirs sued for reconveyance of the title to them.
Lucas’ heirs refused, firstly, on the ground that the trust was an
express one and therefore not enforceable because it was oral;
and secondly, on the ground of prescription (38 years).

HELD: Emilio’s heirs are entitled to the reconveyance.

Firstly, this is not express trust but an implied one under Art.
1453 and, therefore, may be proved by parol evidence. Secondly,

This is a “constructive trust,” the purpose of the law being
to prevent unjust enrichment to the prejudice of the true

owner.
(b)

Example: Marlene was indebted to Susan. For the sole
purpose of guaranteeing her debt, Marlene sold her parcel
of land to Susan. Here, a trust has been created. If Marlene
pays her debt when it becomes due, Marlene may demand
the resale of the property to her.

Art. 1455. When any trustee, guardian or other person
holding a fiduciary relationship uses trust funds for the
purchase of property and causes the conveyance to be made
to him or to a third person, a trust is established by operation
of law in favor of the person to whom the funds belong.

FACTS: A was a confidential employee of B. B intended
to purchase a hacienda and he told A about it and of his option

HELD: No. Since Kilayco never claimed the land, the
court had no jurisdiction to order its registration in Kilayco’s
name. Kilayco in effect was only holding the property in trust
for Laureano.

Aboitiz v. Po
825 SCRA 457
(2017)

Article 1456 of the Civil Code provides that a person acquir¬
ing a property through fraud becomes an implied trustee of the
property’s true and lawful owner.
[NOTE here that in case of a trust, the true owner is
preferred over the registered owner.]
[NOTE: It has been held that a trustee may be compelled
to execute a deed of reconveyance of property that has been
obtained improperly (Ocampo v. Zaporteza, 53 Phil. 442)
provided, of course, that the true owner is not barred because
of prescription or because of laches.]
(2) Effect of a Wrongful Registration

Ocampo v. Ocampo
830 SCRA 418

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1456

(4) Against Whom the Right Must Be Exercised

The right of action in an implied or constructive trust
should be exercised against the trustee, who may have caused
the fraud and not against an innocent purchaser for value. The
action based on the trust should be filed within four years from
the discovery of the fraud. Of course, if the alleged fraudulent
deed was recorded in the Registry of Property, it is essential
to count the four-year period from the date of the registration
inasmuch as said registration operates as a notice to the whole
world. (Avecilla u. Yatco, L-11578, May 14, 1958; and Raymundo,
et al. v. Afable, et al., L-7651, Feb. 28, 1955)
(5) When the Article Does Not Apply

Ongsiako, et al. v. Ongsiako, et al.
L-7510, March 10, 1957

Article 1456 does not apply to a donation of property
which the donee has acquired through a legal donation, even
if she breaks an important condition thereof. Thus, even with
the breach condition, she does not become a trustee. It is still
hers, subject to an action for revocation. If the action to revoke
has prescribed, the property cannot be taken away from her. If
prescription runs even in a case of an implied trust, prescription
certainly runs with greater reason in a case like this, where as
we have seen, no trust ever existed or was created.

(2017)

Wrongful registration gives occasion to the creation of an
implied or constructive trust under Art. 1456 of the Civil Code.
(3) Nature of the Mistake or Fraud

The mistake referred to in Art. 1456 is a mistake made by
a third person, not that made by a party to the contract.
For if made by a party, no trust is created. (Laureano v.
Stevenson, 45 Phil. 252)
(b) Similarly, the fraud referred to in Art. 1456 is extracontractual fraud and the effects are those as mentioned
in Comment No. 4. (Gemora v. Yap Tico, 52 Phil. 616)

944

Tiburcio Samonte v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 104223, July 12, 2001

FACTS: Petitioner, as successor-in-interest of the Jadol
spouses, argues that the respondents’ action for reconveyance,
filed only in 1975, had long prescribed considering that the Jadol
spouses caused the registration of a portion of the subject lot in
their names way back in Aug. 8, 1957. It is petitioner’s contention
that since 18 years had already lapsed from the issuance of TCT
RT-476 until the time when respondents filed the action in the
court a quo in 1975, the same was time-barred. As it had been
indubitably established that fraud attended the registration of a
portion of the subject property, the Jadol spouses were trustees
thereof, on behalf of the surviving heirs of Abao. An action based
945

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Alt. 1456

on implied or constructive trust prescribes in ten years from the
time of its creation or upon the alleged fraudulent registration
of the property.
HELD: Petitioner’s defense of prescription is untenable.
The general rule that the discovery of fraud is deemed to have
taken place upon the registration of real property because it is
“considered a constructive notice to all persons” (Sec. 51 of Act
496, as amended by Sec. 52 of PD 1529) does not apply in this
case. Instead the Court of Appeals correctly applied the ruling
in Adille v. CA (57 SCRA 455 [1988]), which is quite apropos
to the instant case, thus: “It is true that registration under the
Torrens system is constructive notice of title, but it has likewise
been our holding that the Torrens title does not furnish a shield
for fraud. It is, therefore, no argument to say that the act of
registration is equivalent to notice of repudiation, assuming
there was one, notwithstanding the long standing rule that
registration operates as a universal notice of title.” In Adille,
petitioner therein executed a deed of extrajudicial partition
misrepresenting himself to be the sole heir of his mother when,
in fact, she had other children. As a consequence, petitioner
therein was able to secure title to the land in his name alone.
His siblings then filed a case for partition on the ground that
said petitioner was only a trustee on an implied trust of the
property. Among the issues resolved by the Court in that case
was prescription. Said petitioner registered the property in 1955
and the claim of private respondents therein was presented in
1974. Thus, in citing Adille, the Supreme Court said that in the
instant case, the CA rightfully ruled that respondents action for
reconveyance had not yet prescribed.
(6) Query
(a)

— Do Trusts Prescribe?

Express trusts do NOT prescribe as long as they have not
been repudiated. (Diaz v. Garricho, L-11229, March 20,
1958)

(b)

The rule on implied trusts is, however, CONFUSING.

In Diaz, et al. v. Garricho and Agriado, L-11229, March
20, 1958, the Court gave the reason why, as a rule, express
trusts are not subject to prescription, while constructive trusts
may be barred by lapse of time. And the reason is that in the
946

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1456

express trust, there is a promise or a fiduciary relation, hence the
possession of the trustee is NOT ADVERSE until and unless the
beneficiary is made aware that the trust has been repudiated.
But in the constructive trust, imposed as it is by law, there is
no promise or fiduciary relation; the so-called trustee does not
recognize any trust and has no intent to hold for the beneficiary;
therefore, the beneficiary is not justified in delaying the action
to recover his property. It is his fault if he delays; hence, he may
be estopped by his own laches. (See Avecilla v. Yatco, L-11578,
May 14, 1958)

However, in Cordova, et al. v. Cordova, et al., L-9936,
Jan. 14, 1958, the Court in an obiter made the statement that
in a constructive trust (as in the case of co-heirship where one
heir or co-owner fraudulently deprives the rest of their shares),
prescription does not run. This doctrine of imprescriptibility of
a constructive trust was reiterated in Juan v. Zuniga, L-l 7044,
April 28, 1962 and in Jacinto v. Jacinto, L-l 7955, L-l 7957, May
31, 1962, but is directly AT VARIANCE with the rule stated in
J.M. Tuason and Co. v. Macapagal, L-15539, Jan. 30, 1962, and
in the case of Cornelio Alzona, et al. v. Gregoria Capunitan, et
al., L-10228, Feb. 28, 1962, where the Supreme Court held that
indeed prescription RUNS in a constructive trust.
A decision of the Supreme Court reiterates this rule that a
constructive trust is affected by prescription. Thus, in Gerona,
et al. v. Carmen de Guzman, et al., L-19060, May 29, 1964, the
Supreme Court stated that although there are some decisions to
the contrary, it is already settled that an action for reconveyance
of real property based upon a constructive or implied trust,
resulting from fraud, may be BARRED by prescription. The
period is four years from the discovery of the fraud. The Court
apparently overlooked the fact that exactly one month prior to
said decision, it had ruled in Caladiao v. Vda. de Blas, L-19063,
April 29, 1964, that an action to compel reconveyance of property
with a Torrens Title does not prescribe if the registered owner
had obtained registration in bad faith, and the property is still
in the latter’s name. The reason is that the registration is in the
nature of a continuing and subsisting trust.
Similarly, it has been held that prescription cannot be set
up as a defense in an action that seeks to recover property held
expressly in trust for the benefit of another; neither can laches,

it being similar to prescription. (Bachrach Motor Co. v. Lejano,

(7) Some Cases

Ramos, et al. v. Gregoria Ramos, et al.
L-19372, Dec. 3, 1974

ISSUE: Do trusts prescribe?

HELD:
(1)

Express trusts do not prescribe. This means that the
beneficiary or cestui que trust can recover the property
anytime. Reason for the rule the possession of an express
trustee is not adverse. [NOTE: Exception to the rule
even an express trust may prescribe if there has been
repudiation of the same see Escay v. Court of Appeals,
L-37504, Dec. 18, 1974.]

—

—

—

(2)

With respect to implied trusts, a distinction must be made:
(a)

resulting trusts (those presumed to have been
contemplated by the parties, but not so expressed
in the instrument of conveyance) (examples: those
referred to in Arts. 1448 to 1455, Civil Code) generally
also do not prescribe (after all there was the intent to
create an express trust). Exception recovery from
the trustee may prescribe if the trustee has expressly
repudiated the trust;

—

(b)

constructive trusts (justified merely by equity to
satisfy the demands of justice, and therefore are not
really trusts in the technical sense) do prescribe, and
this rule is well-settled. [NOTE: Whether resulting

or constructive, its enforcement may be barred by
LACHES.) (See Nacalaban v. Court of Appeals, 80
SCRA 428; and Duque v. Domingo, 80 SCRA 654)

Armamento v. Central Bank
L-34228, Feb. 21, 1980
An action for reconveyance of registered land based on an
implied trust prescribes in ten years. This is so even if the decree
of registration is no longer open to review.
948

Art. 1456

FACTS: Emilio Escay mortgaged his estate to the
Philippine National Bank. However, in 1924, he died, with his
debt still existing. His brother, Jose Escay, agreed to assume
the debt so that there would be no foreclosure, so the ownership
of the property was transferred to Jose in consideration of his
assumption of the mortgage indebtedness but there was a proviso
granting the heirs of Emilio the right to redeem the property
within five years after Jose shall have fully paid the PNB.
This agreement was approved by the probate court in 1934,
the approval of all parties having been obtained, including the
approval by the heirs of Emilio through Emilio’s wife. Many
years later, Emilio’s children brought the action to recover the
estate from Jose, stating that: (a) their previous consent has
not been obtained re the transfer of the property to Jose, (b) the
probate court has no power to authorize the transfer as, in effect,
this would be the same as a foreclosure, and (c) Jose refused to
allow the heirs to redeem.
HELD:
(a)

The heirs may be said to have consented, through their
mother (their guardian ad litem).

(b)

The probate court had the power to approve the agreement,
even if the same amounted to a foreclosure, for after all
procedural rules cannot impair substantive rights of
property owners to sell what belongs to them.

(c)

More than 25 years have elapsed since Jose took adverse
possession of the property. It is clear that the action has
prescribed. Under an express trust, if repudiated, may end
after ten years (or 30 years), as the case may be.

Horacio G. Adaza & Felicidad Marundan v.
Court of Appeals & Violeta G. Adaza, Assisted
by Her Husband Lino Amor
L-47354, March 21, 1989
In determining whether delay in seeking to enforce
a right constitutes laches, the existence of a confidential
relationship based upon, for instance, consanguinity, is
an important circumstance for consideration. Delay in a
situation where such a circumstance exists should not be
as strictly construed, as where the parties are complete
strangers vis-a-vis each other. The doctrine of laches is not
to be applied mechanically as between near relatives; the
fact that the parties in the instant case are brother and
sister tends to explain and excuse what would otherwise
appear as long delay.
Moreover, continued recognition of the existence of the
trust precludes the defense of laches. The two letters sent
by respondent Violeta to petitioner Horacio, one in 1969
and the other in 1971, show that Violeta as late as 1971 had
recognized the trust imposed on her by law. Conversely,
Horacio’s reliance upon his blood relationship with his
sister and the trust and confidence normally connoted
in our culture by that relationship, should not be taken
against him. Petitioner’s counterclaim in the trial court for
partition and reconveyance cannot be regarded as barred
whether by laches or by prescription.
Gonzales, et al. v. IAC
GR 66479, Nov. 21, 1991

FACTS: Respondents have invoked Art. 1456 of
the Civil Code which states that “if property is acquired
through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is, by
force of law, considered a trustee of an implied trust for
the benefit of the person from whom the property comes."

HELD: The trust alluded to in this case is a cons¬
tructive trust arising by operation of law. It is not a trust
950

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1456

in the technical sense. Even assuming that there was
an implied trust, respondent’s attempt at reconveyance
(functionally, an action for partition is both an action for
declaration of ownership, and for segregation of conveyance
of a determinate portion of the subject property) was barred
by prescription. An action for reconveyance of real property
to enforce an implied trust prescribes in ten years, the
period reckoned from the issuance of the adverse title to
the property which operates as a constructive notice. In
the case at bar, that assertion of adverse title, which was
an explicit indication of repudiation of the trust for the
purpose of the statute of limitations, took place when OCT
496812 was issued in the name of Fausto Soy in 1932, to
the exclusion of his three sisters. But even if there was no
repudiation as respondent Rosita Lopez would have us
believe when she testified in court that while Fausto Soy
might have succeeded in securing title in his sole name, he
nonetheless recognized the co-ownership between him and
his sisters the rule in this jurisdiction is that an action to
enforce an implied trust may be circumscribed not only by
prescription but also by laches, in which case repudiation
is not even required. From 1932 to 1965, or a period of 33
years, respondents had slept on their rights, presuming
they had any. They can no longer dispute the conclusive
and incontrovertible character of Fausto Soy’s title as they
are deemed, by their unreasonably long inaction to have
acquiesced therein. Moreover, the law protects those who
are vigilant of their rights. Undue delay in the enforcement
of a right is strongly indicative of a lack of merit in the
claim, since it is human nature for persons to assert their
rights most vigorously when threatened or invaded.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Inc. v. Navarro, 43 SCRA 503; and Alzona v. Capunitan
and Reyes, 114 Phil. 377) The action was filed only in
1952 or 41 years after the registration. The plaintiffs,
and their predecessor in interest (Valentin Salao), slept
on their rights, if they had any rights at all. Vigilanti
prospiciunt jura (“The law protects him who is watchful
of his rights”). Further, there was laches or unreasonable
delay in trying to enforce a right. If there be laches, this is
not only persuasive of a want of merit, but may, according
to the circumstances, be destructive of the right itself.
(Buenaventura v. David, 37 Phil. 435)

HELD: The prescriptive period is ten years, not one
year from entry of the decree of registration. Otherwise
stated, the Court of Appeals is correct in holding
that respondent’s complaint is in reality an action for
reconveyance based on implied or constructive trust. This
suit prescribes ten years from issuance of title over the
property. (Villanueva-Mijares v. CA, 330 SCRA 349 [2000];
and Marquez v. CA, 300 SCRA 653 [1998])

(8) How to Prove Trusts

Salao, et al. v. Salao
L-26699, March 16, 1976

FACTS: Ambrosia Salao and Juan Salao (sister and
brother) purchased from the heirs of Engracio Santiago the
Calunuran fishpond, and were granted a Torrens Title over
said property in 1917. After Ambrosia’s death, the heirs of
Valentin Salao, the nephew of the two co-owners, sued in 1952
for reconveyance of the fishpond which they claimed had been
held in trust for their father by the two registered co-owners. But
no documentary evidence was presented to prove the existence
of an express trust. All that they presented was oral testimony
to the effect that in the partition of his (Valentin’s) grandfather’s
estate, said fishpond had been assigned to him.

ISSUES: (1) Was there an express trust? (2) Was there
an implied trust? (3) Assuming there was an implied trust, has
the action for reconveyance prescribed?
HELD:
(1)

There was no express trust. Oral or parol evidence cannot
prove an express trust. (Art. 1443, Civil Code)

(2)

There was no implied trust, whether resulting trust or
constructive trust. There was no resulting trust for there
was never any intention to create a trust and there was no
constructive trust, because the registration of the fishpond
under the Torrens system was not initiated by fraud or
mistake.

(3)

Assuming that there was an implied trust, the action is
already barred by prescription or laches. (See Varsity Hills,
952

Art. 1457

[NOTE: However, although prescription and laches may
defeat an implied trust, there is one exception to the rule.
Movables acquired through a crime cannot be acquired by the
offender through prescription. (Art. 1133, Civil Code)]
[NOTE: While Art. 1456 is not retroactive in character,
still it merely expresses a rule already recognized by our Courts
even prior to the promulgation of the New Civil Code. (Diaz v.
Garricho and Agriado, supra)]
(9) How ‘Creative Trusts’ Are Formed

This is by way of equity to prevent uryust enrichment,
arising against one who, by fraud, duress or abuse of confidence,
obtains or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in
equity and good conscience, to hold. (Catalina Vda. de Retuerto
