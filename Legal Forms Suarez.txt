DEDICATION
To my wife, Nora, and my children, Revelyn, Rhonnel, Ricci,
and Rizza; to my beloved parents, Marcelo A. Suarez' and Elena
Arevalo Suarez,' my first teachers, who taught me the rudiments of
writing and the value of hard work; to my thoughtful and loving aunt,
Cornelia Arevalo Vda. De Capul; to my kind and equally thoughtful
mother-in-law, Niflea Lautchang Vda. De Manalese, who just
passed away; to my deceased brothers and sisters, Buendegardo,
Proserfina, Elvira, Manolo and Rodolfo, with whom I have shared
the blessings of a modest home and hardworking parents; to all my
former teachers who cared to enlighten me with their knowledge; to
my townmates and friends who share my thoughts and aspirations
for a better society; and above all, to my dear God who is always
generous to help me in any of my endeavors, I dedicate this humble
work.

PREFACE
The first edition of this book was printed in 2007, and since
then it was just re-printed every time the remaining copies of the
book are exhausted.
On account of the continuing patronage of the book, and my
desire to improve it and be able to share different documents and
pleadings my office prepares in the course of law practice, I decided
to prepare a second edition.
It will be noticed that the book contains not only the examples
of documents and pleadings but also a brief discussion of the laws,
rules, and procedures involved. My purpose is to be able to help
lawyers and non-lawyers using the book to know at a glance, the
substantive and procedural laws involved.
The advent of modern day business transactions and the
cases that we have today, be it in the field of civil law, corporate
law, criminal law, tax law, labor law, administrative law, mining,
admiralty law, and transportation law, and even in international
law, are getting more complex from day to day.
With all these developments, I am expecting that future books
on legal forms will have to contain more information, including more
innovations and requirements to guide lawyers and non-lawyers
using the book and to give them basic knowledge and familiarity on
documents and pleadings that they will prepare.
The pioneer authors, Sen. Lorenzo M. Tarada and
Sen. Francisco "Soc" A. Rodrigo, Sr., and Atty. Simplicio Guevara,
have contributed greatly in sharing their experiences and expertise.
The next ones will contribute their share and this will go on this way
from one generation to another.
Let this modest piece of work be my humble contribution.
Paranaque City,
ROLANDO A. SUAREZ

INTRODUCTION

484

This book is intended to provide students and lawyers, and
even the general public, with examples of different documents,
pleadings and other legal forms, that will help them in the drafting
and preparing documents and pleadings which they think will be
suited to their own needs. The author thinks, however, that his
modest work will be more complete and valuable if he could share
other knowledge and information which are worth knowing and
interesting to learn.

Throughout the four corners of the Philippines, especially in
progressive towns and cities, people from all walks of life need the
services of a notary public from time to time. The documents prepared
by their lawyers will not be complete if they are not notarized.
Hence, affidavits, contracts, oaths and affirmations, lease, mortgage,
assignment, power of attorney, articles of incorporation, sale of
real and personal property, last will and testament, extrajudicial
settlement, among many other documents, have to be notarized so
they will be public documents.
Several pleadings have also to be verified, as prescribed by the
Revised Rules of Court. Many laymen often ask why those documents
and pleadings have to be notarized, and why it is necessary to engage
the services of a notary public who just signs in the last page of the
document.
The office of the notary public, its historical background,
its meaning and nature, its duties and responsibilities, and its
importance are not known to many people, especially those who
have no legal background and education.
This revised edition consists of three parts:
Part I covers the following subjects: History of Notarial
Law, Office of Notary Public, its meaning and nature, its duties
and responsibilities, definitions and distinctions, business and
administrative forms, actual examples of contracts or agreements
usually requested by clients, and actual examples of modern-day

contracts. The latter surfaced when new business concepts and
ideas were introduced, such as but not limited to the following:
Condominium Business, Building Contracts, Distributorship, Sale
of Condominium Unit, Lease of Condominium Unit, Copyrights and
Trademarks, Memorial Park, Perpetual Care, Call Centers, (the
operation of which has resulted to many labor cases), Online Sales
and Marketing, Franchise Business (the operation of which have
also resulted to manpower services as well as to labor problems and
cases), and many others.

Part 11 covers the following subjects: The importance of a good

verified, pleadings that need not be verified in the manner and form
prescribed by Section 14, Rule 7, but which must be under oath, and
all judicial forms and pleadings in six principal subjects, thus:
1.
2.

Part III covers the following subjects: Miscellaneous topics,
proceedings and forms in different bureaus, agencies, and offices of

1.

provisions of the corporation code

5.

Commission on Elections

6.

Insolvency Proceedings

With all the foregoing topics and subjects being covered, the
author thinks that law students and lawyers, and even laymen, will
be properly guided in the drafting and preparation of a good pleading
or contract, one which is respectable, both in form and in substance.
It needs emphasis to state that a good and nice pleading or
contract is a gauge not only of the worthiness and personality of
a lawyer but also of the worthiness of the issues, or the defenses
raised in the pleading, or of the validity or fairness of the provisions
in a contract.
They manifest outright the ability and personality of the lawyer
who drafted the pleading or contract. Hence, a pleading or contract
with a lot of grammatical errors irritates not only a lawyer or a judge
but also anyone who reads it. Dirty and awkward pleadings and
contracts coupled with poor format, aggravate such an irritation,
and necessarily, the lawyer who prepared them fails to gain respect
of his opposing counsel.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE
NEW SYSTEM OF CONVEYANCING

THE LAW THAT GOVERNED NOTARIAL PRACTICE
BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
1.

DURING THE SPANISH REGIME
The law that governed notarial practice was the Spanish
Notarial Law of February 15, 1889. A body of general
instructions for drafting instruments subject to record or
registration was promulgated in the Philippines on October 3,
1889. On April 11, 1890, regulations to carry out the provisions
of said Notarial Law were issued.

2.

AFTER THE SPANISH REGIME, AMERICAN MILITARY
RULE IN THE PHILIPPINES BEGAN ON APRIL 14, 1898
a.

The Military Government issued General Order No. 40
dated September 23, 1899, and General Order No. 20
dated February 3, 1900, introducing modifications in said
law.

b.

On June 11, 1901, the Philippine Commission passed
the Judiciary Law or Act No. 136. Chapter II of said law
provided for the appointment, qualifications, powers
and duties of Notaries Public. It also provided that the
Notarial Law of February 15, 1889, together with the
regulations implementing the same and the military
orders that modified the same should continue in force
until the law establishing a new system of registration of
land title is passed.

OLD SYSTEM
(Under Spanish Notarial Law)

NEW SYSTEM
(Under Administrative
Code of 1917)

a.

The documents were pre- a.
pared in the form of minutes. It is the Notary Public
who spoke.

It is the party executing
the deed who speaks, and
the notary is limited to the
taking of acknowledgment.

b.

It was sufficient to look at b.
the text of the instrument
in order to determine the
capacity in which a person
executed a document. The
reason for this is because
the preparation of the
instrument was attended
with solemnity.

It is necessary to resort to the
forms in which the parties
sign an instrument because
it is the signature rather
than the text which bears
the stamp of authenticity.

OFFICE OF THE NOTARY PUBLIC
a.

Brief Historical Background

The office of notary public has an ancient origin. It existed
in ancient Rome and in all the early Christian countries of
Europe. Formerly, notaries were appointed by kings, by the
Pope, or by the highest ecclesiastical authority of the land. For
this reason, the office of notary public had long been known
both in civil and canon law. It was also long known to the law
of nations. The main function of notaries was to draw up legal
documents which were of great use to merchants and other
persons who wanted to have their transaction authenticated.
Notaries were authorized to attest documents in order to
be admissible as evidence of the contents thereof or of the
execution of the same in courts or government offices. Thus,
his official acts were given full faith and credit not only in his
own country but also in foreign lands. (Antillon v. Barcelon, 37
Phil. 148)
b.

Meaning of Notary

A notary is a public officer whose duty is to attest the
genuineness of any deed or writing in order to render them
available as evidence of the facts therein contained.
He is a public functionary, authorized to receive all acts
and contracts to which parties wish to give the character of
authenticity, attached to the act of public authority, to secure
their date, their preservation, and the delivery of copies.
One whose duties generally are to protect bills of
exchange, authenticate and certify copies of documents and take
acknowledgments of deeds and other instruments administer
oaths, etc. The acts of a notary are respected by the custom
of merchants and the law of nations. Their protest of a bill of

10

LEGAL FORMS

exchange is received as evidence in the courts of all civilized
countries. Except in cases of protest of bills, the signature of a
notary to an instrument going to a foreign country should be
authenticated by the consul or representative of that country.
(Phil. Legal Encyclopedia, by Jose Agaton R. Sibal)
\
A notary public is "a public officer whose function is to
attest and certify, by his hand and official seal, certain classes
of document, in order to give them credit and authenticity
in foreign jurisdictions; to take acknowledgments of deeds
and other conveyances, and certify the same; and to perform
certain official acts, chiefly in commercial matters, such as the
protesting of notes and bills, and noting of foreign drafts, and
marine protests in cases of loss or damage." (The Phil. Notarial
Law & Legal Forms, by Francisco Ventura)

CHAPTER II

LEGAL FORMS
1.

Form is important when the law requires a document or
other special form, such as those mentioned in Article 1358 of
the New Civil Code.

COVERAGE OF LEGAL FORMS

Article 1358. The following must appear in a public
document:

The term "Legal Forms" covers the study of:
a.

WHEN IS FORM IMPORTANT?

Business Fonns -The forms used in conveyancing,

(1)

Acts and contracts which have for their object the
creation, transmission, modification or extinguishment of real rights over immovable property; sales of
real property or of an interest therein are governed by
Articles 1403, No. 2, and 1405;

(2)

The cession, repudiation or renunciation ofhereditary
rights or of those of the conjugal partnership ofgains;

(3)

The power to administer property, or any other power
which has for its object an act appearing or which
should appear in a public document, or should
prejudice a third person;

(4)

The cession of actions or rights proceeding from an
act appearing in a public document.

or of the forms of deeds, instruments or documents
creating, transferring, modifying or limiting rights
to real as well as personal properties, and other
forms related to business contracts or transactions.
b.

2.

Judicial Forms
The forms which pertain to
different kinds of pleadings, applications, petitions,
affidavits, motions, and the like.

WHY SHOULD AN AGREEMENT BE IN WRITING?
The memory of people is short. Parties to a verbal
agreement often disagree as to what they have agreed several
months or years after they have entered into a verbal agreement.
To avoid such a situation and in order to have a clear guide and
evidence of the terms they have agreed, lawyers, or even the
parties themselves, request a written agreement.

All other contracts where the amount involved exceeds
five hundred pesos must appear in writing, even a private one.
But sales of goods, chattels or things in action are governed by
Articles 1403, No. 2 and 1405.

IS FORM REQUIRED FOR VALIDITY
OF A CONTRACT?
4.

RULE:
Contracts shall be obligatory, in whatever form they
may have been entered into, PROVIDED that all the essential
requisites for their validity are present. (Art. 1356, 1st par.,
New Civil Code)
Exception:
However, when the law requires that a contract be in
some form in order that it may be valid or enforceable, or that
32

OTHER INSTANCES WHEN AN AGREEMENT OR A
CONTRACT SHOULD BE IN A PUBLIC DOCUMENT
a.

Donation of an immovable property should be in a public
instrument in order to be valid (Art. 749, New Civil Code);
acceptance of the same may be made in the same deed of
donation or in a separate public document.

b.

A pledge shall not take effect against third persons if a
description of the thing pledged and the date of the pledge
do not appear in a public instrument. (Art. 2096, New
Civil Code)

LEGAL FORMS

34

c.

5.

6.

No deed, mortgage, lease or other instrument shall
take effect as a conveyance or bind the land, unless it
is registered. Said instruments should therefore be in
the form of public documents in order that they can be
registered in the Registry of Deeds.

EVERY WILL MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED BEFORE
A NOTARY PUBLIC BY THE TESTATOR AND THE
WITNESSES

CHAPTER Ill

DEFINITIONS AND DISTINCTIONS
1.

CONVEYANCE

However, the notary public shall not be required to retain
a copy of the will, or file another with the office of the Clerk of
Court. (Art. 806, New Civil Code)

2.

REMEDY IF THE TRUE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES
IS NOT EXPRESSED IN THE INSTRUMENT

DEED - A written instrument under seal containing a
contract or agreement which has been delivered by the parties
to be bound and accepted by the obligee or covenantee.

3.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN A DEED AND A WILL- In
order that an instrument may be operative as a deed, it should
pass a present interest, although it is not necessary that the
grantee take[s] a present estate in the property conveyed. A
deed once executed and delivered is irrevocable in the absence of
reservation of the right to revoke. In the case of a testamentary
instrument, it operates only upon and by reason of the death of
the maker. During his lifetime, it is ambulatory and revocable.

4.

DOCUMENT It is a writing or instrument by which a fact

Article 1359. When, there having been a meeting of
the minds of the parties to a contract, their true intention is
not expressed in the instrument purporting to embody the
agreement, by reason of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct
or accident, one of the parties may ask for the reformation of
the instrument to the end that such true intention may be
expressed. (New Civil Code)

7.

REMEDY IF MISTAKE, FRAUD, INEQUITABLE
CONDUCT, OR ACCIDENT HAS PREVENTED THE
MEETING OF THE MINDS OF THE PARTIES

A deed whereby the ownership of a real
property is transferred from one person to another.

may be proven or affirmed. A document may either be a: (a)
Private document; or a (b) Public document.

Article 1359. xx x If mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct,
or accident has prevented a meeting of the minds of the parties,
the proper remedy is not reformation of the instrument but
annulment of the contract. (New Civil Code)

6.

a.

PRIVATE DOCUMENT - a deed or instrument
executed by a private person, without the intervention
of a notary public or of other person legally authorized,
by which a document, some disposition or agreement is
proved, evidenced or set forth.

b.

PUBLIC DOCUMENT an instrument authenticated
by a notary public or a competent public official, with the
formalities required by law; an instrument executed in
due form before a notary certified by him; that which is
made by a notary public in the presence of the parties who
executed it, with the assistance of two witnesses.

(Add "Jurat")
INSTANCES WHEN AN AFFIDAVIT IS EXECUTED
IN SUPPORT OF A PETITION OR MOTION

EXAMPLES:
1.
When the petition to be filed by the plaintiff pertains
to a provisional remedy (attachment, preliminary injunction,
receivership, replevin and alimony pendente lite). In said cases, the
remedies which may be availed of by the petitioner are temporary
in character because they are subject to modification that may be
ordered when judgment is finally rendered. (Rules 57, 58, 59, 60, 61,
New Rules of Court)
2.
When the property attached or subject of attachment
is claimed by any person other than the party against whom

RULES AND PRINCIPLES AT A GLANCE

1.

ATTACHMENT

Definition

It is the provisional remedy which is ancillary to a principal
action whereby a plaintiff or any proper party may, at the
commencement of the action or at any time thereafter, have the
property of the adverse party attached or taken into legal custody as
security for the satisfaction of the judgment that may be recovered.
Three kinds of attachment

(a)

Preliminary Attachment - An attachment which is
given at the beginning of an action or during its pendency
or before the finality of the judgment.

(b)

Garnishment An attachment allowing the plaintiff to
reach credits, whether money or property, belonging to
or owned by the debtor or owing to him from someone
who is not a party to the litigation. The latter is, in effect,
ordered to pay the new creditors, not the old creditors.

to enforce or satisfy a final and executory judgment.

IMPORTANCE OF AFFIDAVIT REQUIRED BY RULE 57,

53

or attachment of the property of the plaintiff, or if so
seized, that it is EXEMPT from such seizure; and (c)
the actual value of the property. (Rule 60, Sec. 2)

PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

The affidavit is the foundation of the writ.
Definition
EFFECT IF NO AFFIDAVIT IS FILED, OR IF THE
AFFIDAVIT THAT WAS FILED WHOLLY FAILS
TO SET OUT THE FACTS REQUIRED BY RULE
57, SECTION 3

It is an order granted at any stage of an action prior to the
finality of a judgment requiring a person to refrain from a particular
act or requiring the performance of a particular act.

There is no jurisdiction and the proceedings are null and void.
The writ of preliminary attachment issued against the property of
the defendant is fatally defective, and the judge issuing it is deemed
to have acted in excess of his jurisdiction. Moreover, it cannot be
covered by amendment. (Jardine Manila Finance, Inc. v. Court of
Appeals [1989] 171 SCRA 636, 645 citing K.O. Glass Construction
Co., Inc. u. Valenzuela, 116 SCRA 568 [1982))

Grounds for Issuance of Preliminary Injunction

2.

I.

That the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and
the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the
commission or continuance of the acts complained of, or
in the performance of an act or acts either for a limited
period or perpetually.

2.

That the commission or continuance of some acts
complained of during the litigation or non-performance
thereof would probably work injustice to the plaintiff.

3.

That the defendant is doing, threatening, or is about
to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done some act
probably in violation of the plaintiffs rights respecting the
subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment
ineffectual. (Rule 58, Sec. 3)

REPLEVIN

Definition
It is a provisional remedy whereby the plaintiff petitions the
court to compel in the meantime the delivery to him of such personal
property mentioned in his complaint. The plaintiff may ask for this
remedy at the commencement of the action, or at any time before
the answer.
4.

RECEIVERSHIP

Requirements:
l.

The plaintiff must show by his own affidavit or that of
some other person who personally knows the fact:
(a)

That the plaintiff is the owner of the property
claimed particularly describing it, or is entitled to
the possession thereof;

(b0)

That the property is WRONGFULLY DETAINED
by the defendant (the cause of detention must be
alleged according to the petitioner's knowledge,
information and belief);

(c)

That it has: (a) not been taken for a tax assessment or
fine pursuant to law; or (b) not seized under execution

Definition
It is provisional remedy whereby the court appoints a receiver
to hold the real or personal property in litigation during its pendency
with power to possess, take hold of, control and to dispose of the
same as may be allowed by the court in proper cases.
WHEN TO APPOINT A RECEIVER
1.

When a corporation has been dissolved, or insolvent, or
in imminent danger of insolvency, or has forfeited its
corporate rights.

LEGAL FORMS

54

2.

3.

4.

5.

5.

When the party applying for the appointment of a receiver
has an interest in the property involved which may be
lost, removed, or materially injured.
When in a case of foreclosure of a mortgage: (a) the property is in danger of being wasted or materially injured
and its value is probably insufficient to discharge the
mortgage debt; (b) there was a stipulation for receivership in the mortgage contract.
When there is already a judgment BUT: (a) the property
has to be preserved during the appeal; (b) the judgment
could not be executed; or (c) the judgment obligor refuses
to apply his property in satisfaction of the judgment or
otherwise to make the judgment effective.

[A motion for summary judgment must be accompanied with
supporting affidavits. (Rule 34, Secs. I and 2, Rules of Court) The
adverse party must, prior to the day of hearing, serve opposing
affidavits. (Rule 34, Sec. 5, Rules of Court)]

2.

The summons in the above-entitled case was not actually
served and personally served to me;

3.

Not being a lawyer and therefore not familiar with legal
procedures, I thought all the while that the motion for
postponement filed by the plaintiff is sufficient. Otherwise,
I could have filed, through counsel, an answer;

4.

My failure and inability to file an answer on time is
attributed to the following reasons:

1.

The supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on
personal knowledge, shall state such facts as would be admissible in
evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent
to testify to the matters stated herein. Sworn or certified copies of all
papers and parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached

If the affidavits presented pursuant to Rule 34 are presented in
bad faith, or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall order the
party employing them to pay to the other party the amount of the
reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused him to

CHAPTER IV
AFFIDAVIT

I was able to return only on,and it was
only then when I learned that there was a summons
received by my housemaid. I immediately went to
see my counsel, but unfortunately, he was abroad at
that time;
Not being lawyer and not knowing the rudiments
of legal procedures, what I did is to file an Urgent
Motion for Postponement. In fact, since my lawyer
was out of the country, it was only myself who
prepared the said motion;
Being unfamiliar with legal procedures and legal
requirements, I did not realize that what I have to
file is an answer;

(!)

To make matters wors[e], my counsel informed me
that he could no longer continue to handle my case
and he advised me to engage the services of another
lawyer;

(g)

That I am in good faith and I respectfully seek the
kind consideration, compassion, and understanding
of this Honorable Court regarding my predicament
and failure to file my answer on time. I give my
assurance, however, that I have no intention
whatsoever to disregard the order of this Honorable
Court;

5.

That a grave miscarriage of justice will result if I will not
be given an opportunity to file an answer to the instant
petition;

6.

That with the kind indulgence, compassion and
understanding of this Honorable Court, I courteously
pray that the attached answer be admitted;

CHAPTER VIII

GENERAL AND SPECIAL AGENCIES
MEANING OF AGENCIES
Article 1868 states: "By the contract of agency a person binds
himself to render some service or to do something in representation
or on behalf of another, with the consent or authority of the latter."
Agency is important because it enables a man to increase the
range of his individual and corporate activity by enabling him to
be constructively present in many places and to carry on diverse
activities at the same time.

79

(5) To enter into any contract by which the ownership of an
immovable is transmitted or acquired either gratuitously
or for a valuable consideration;
(6) To make gifts, except customary ones for charity or those
made to employees in the business managed by the agent;
(7) To loan or borrow money, unless the latter act be urgent
and indispensable for the preservation of the things which
are under administration;
(8) To lease any real property to another person for more
than one year;
(9) To bind the principal to render some service without
compensation;
(10) To bind the principal in a contract of partnership;
(11) To obligate the principal as a guarantor or surety;
(12) To create or convey real rights over immovable property;

ACCORDING TO THE POWER OF AUTHORITY
CONFERRED THE AGENCY MAY BE:
1.

2.

Couched in general terms.
Article 1877 states: "An
agency couched in general terms comprises only acts of
administration, even if the principal should state that he
withholds no power or that the agent may execute such acts as
he may consider appropriate, or even though the agency should
authorize a general and unlimited management."
Or couched in specific terms Article 1878 states: "Special
Power of Attorney is necessary in the following cases:
(1) To make such payments are not usually considered as
acts of administration;
(2) T effect novations which put an end to obligations
already existing at the time the agency was constituted;
(3) To compromise, to submit questions to arbitration to
renounce the right to appeal from a judgment, to waive
objections to the venue of an action or to abandon a
prescription already acquired;
(4) To waive any obligation gratuitously;
78

(13) To accept or repudiate an inheritance;
(14) To ratify or recognize obligations contracted before the
agency;
(15) Any other act of strict dominion"

of an act. Article 1878 specifies
when a special power of attorney is needed because the acts
involved are acts of dominion or

FORMALITIES NEEDED FOR THE CREATION OF A
PARTNERSHIP

CHAPTER IX

PARTNERSHIP
1.

(a)

DEFINITION OF PARTNERSHIP
"By the contract of partnership two or more persons bind
themselves to contribute money, property, or industry to a
common fund, with the intention of dividing the profits among
themselves." (Art. 1767, New Civil Code)

2.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A CONTRACT OF PARTNERSHIP
It is a consensual contract because it is perfected by mere
consent.
There must be a contribution of money, property or
industry to a common fund.

Failure to comply with the requirements of the preceding
paragraph shall not affect the liability of the partnership and
the members thereof to the third persons."
86

6.

less than three thousand pesos (P3,000.00) total may be oral.

2)

P3,000.00 or more - must be in public instrument
and registered in the Securities and Exchange
Commission. But even if this is not complied with,
the partnership is still valid and possesses a clistinct
personality. (Art. 1772, 1768, Cwil Code) Evidently,
the requirement is merely for administrative and
licensing purposes.

(c)

Limited Property
Must be registered AS SUCH in
the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
otherwise, it is not valid as a limited partnership. (NOTE:
However even without such registration, it may still be
considered a general partnership, and as such, possesses
juridical personality.) (See Arts. 1843, 1844, Civil Code)

There must be the desire to formulate an active union
(affectio societatis) with people among whom there exists
mutual confidence and trust. (delectus personarum)

ARTICLE 1772 STATES: "Every contract of partnership
having a capital of three thousand pesos or more, in money
or property, shall appear in a public instrument, which must
be recorded in the Office of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

1)

Real Property
Regardless of the value contributed, a
public instrument is needed, with an attached inventory,
otherwise the partnership is VOID and NO juridical
personality even as between the parties. (Art. 1773, Civil
Code) Moreover, to be effective against third parties, the
partnership must also be registered in the Registry of the
province, where the real property contributed is found.
After all, there is an alienation here of a real right on real
property.

There must be an intention of dividing the profits among
the partners.

The partnership has a personality separate and distinct
from that of the partners.

Personal Property

(b)

The object must be a lawful one.

3.

87

DISTINCTION: GENERAL PARTNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
(a)

General Partnership is one where all the partners are
general partners (that is/are liable even with respect
to their individual properties, after the assets of the
partnership have been exhausted).

LEGAL FORMS

88

CHAPTER IX
PARTNERSHIP

(b)

Limited Partnership is one where at least one partner
is general partner and the others are limited partners. (A
limited partner is one whose liability is limited only up to
the extent of his contributions.)
NOTE: A partner where all the partners are "limited
partners" cannot exist as a limited partnership; it will
even be refused registration. If at all it continues, it will
be a general partnership, and all the partners will be
general partners.

CORPORATION
SAID ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION IS SUBJECT
TO EXA MINATION AND APPROVAL OF SEC

DEFINITION

A corporation is an artificial being created by operation of
law, having the right of succession and the powers, attributes and
properties expressly authorized by law or incident to its existence.

When all the legal requirements requested by the SEC are
complied with, the certificate of incorporation will then be issued
and only then shall the corporation have a personality separate and
distinct from its stockholders.

On the basis of said definition, a corporation owns its life to the
State, its birth being dependent on its will. It is a creature without
any existence until it has received the imprimatur of the state
according to law.

However, the SEC may revoke the same if it finds that the
incorporators were guilty of fraud in procuring the certificate of
incorporation.

Corporation therefore, big or small, must abide by the
provisions of the Corporation Code. And they cannot have rules and
practices other than those established by law.
Contracts by and among persons wanting to form a corporation,
is subject to the power of the State to grant or not to grant the
franchise so requested. Under this principle, the corporation is a
creature of the State, and therefore within the control of the latter.
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

It is the charter of the corporation. It defines the contract and
relationship between the corporation and the State, the stockholders
and the State, and between the corporation and its stockholders.
To be binding, the Articles of Incorporation must be filed with
and registered with SEC, and approved by the latter.
However, Articles of Incorporation of banks, public utilities,
insurance companies, etc., will not be registered by the SEC unless
said articles are accompanied by a favorable recommendation
from the appropriate agencies supervising such special types or
corporations.
NOTE: Unlike before when the documents, i.e., Articles of
Incorporation, By-Laws, Treasurer's Certificate, Undertaking to
94

MAY THESE DENY OR REFUSE REGISTRATION
OF ANY CORPORATION?

Under P.D. No. 902-A, the SEC may look beyond the terms of
the Articles of Incorporation, and may refuse registration. Hence,
the Articles of Incorporation may contain lawful purposes but if
other circumstances show that the applicant's establishment or
operation may run counter to the nation's economic policies, the
SEC may refuse registration.
The SEC may also do so upon consultation with the BO! (Board
of Industries) and the NEDA (National Economic Development
Authority), when the operation is not consistent with national
economic policies.
IN CASE OF BANKS

The certificate of incorporation shall not be issued unless the
Monetary Board is satisfied from the evidence submitted to it that
the following are complied with:
1.

All requirements of existing laws and regulations to
engage in the business for which the applicant is proposed
to be incorporated have been complied with;

2.

The public interest and economic conditions, both general
and local, justify an authorization; and

LEGAL FORMS

96

3.

The amount of capital, the financing, organization,
direction and administration, as well as the integrity

shall not register the Articles of Incorporation unless accompanied by
a certificate of authority issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

BASIC RULES TO REMEMBER
CONTENTS OF ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

Section 14 of the Corporation Code provides that all
corporations organized thereunder shall file with the SEC articles
of incorporation in any of the official languages, duly signed and
acknowledged by all the incorporators, containing substantially the
following matters.
(a)

Name of the corporation;

(b)

Purpose clauses, and should distinguish the primary
purpose from the secondary purposes, should the
corporation have more than one purpose; a non-stock
corporation shall not include a purpose which would
change or contradict its nature;

(c)

Place of principal office within the Philippines;

97

1.

The name of the corporation cannot be changed except in
the manner provided by law.

2.

It is by the name that the corporation can sue and be
sued, and perform all other legal acts.

PURPOSE- The purpose of a corporation must be lawful.
RESIDENCE OF CORPORATION Article 51 of the Civil Code
provides that "when the law creating or recognizing them, or any
other provision does not fix the domicile ofjuridical persons, the same
shall be understood to be the place where their legal representation
is established or where they exercise their principal functions."
Clavecil/a Radio System v. Antillon, 19 SCRA 379 (1967),
held that the residence of a corporation is the place where its

98

LEGAL FORMS

principal office is established; it can be sued in that place, not in the
place where its branch office is located.

A corporation in a metaphysical sense is a resident of a place
where its principal office is located as stated in the articles of
incorporation and cannot be allowed to file a personal action in a
place other than that place.
Sy v. Tyson Enterprises, Inc., 119 SCRA 367 (1982), held
that the residence of the president for purposes of venue and
service of summons is not the residence of the corporation because a
corporation has a personality separate and distinct from that of its
officers and stockholders.
For purpose of venue in intra-corporate suits, under Section 5,
Rule 1, of the Interim of Procedure Governing Intra-corporate Controversies, when the articles of incorporation indicate that the principal place of business is ''Metro Manila" as allowed under Section 5,
of the Corporation Code, then the action must be filed in the city or
municipality where the head office is actually located.
SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON A CORPORATION
Under
Section 11, Rule 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure of the
Philippines, if the defendant in a suit is a corporation organized
under the laws of the Philippines, service may be made on the
president, general manager, corporate secretary, treasurer, or inhouse counsel.
In one case, the Supreme Court noted that the rationale of the
rules of service of process on corporation is that service must be
made on a representative so integrated with the corporation sued as
to make it a priori supposable that he will realize his responsibilities
and know what he should do with any legal papers served on him.
It then held the service of summons upon the assistant general
manager and has served the purpose of the law.
INCORPORATING STOCKHOLDERS OR MEMBERS Section 10 of the Corporation Code provides that any number of
natural persons not less than five but not more 15, all of legal age
and majority of whom are residents of the Philippines, may form a
private corporation for any lawful purpose.
Only natural persons can be incorporators. However, the law
does not preclude corporations and partnership from becoming
stockholders or members as long as they are not incorporators. The

CHA PT ER X
CORPORA TION

99

issue has been raised before on what is the need for legislating that
incorporators must be natural persons, and it was held then that:
"From this premise, it was easy to give vitality to
the ancestral abhorrence of corporations. Judges could
not imagine why a corporation which "has no soul to be
damned and nobody to be kicked" should be empowered
to incorporate other corporation. The strongest statement
of this fear is found in Schwab v, Potter Co. [194N.Y.
409, 416] as follows: " 'Artificial persons, 'without brain or
body, existing only on paper through legislative command
and incapable of thought or action except through natural
persons, cannot create other 'artificial persons, • and those,
others still, until the line is so extended and the capital
stock so duplicated, as to result in confusion and fraud."
The logic is unassailable once the premise is accepted.
The "fiction" theory of corporate personality invades this
area of the law. This is hardly the occasion to discuss a
subject that has engaged the attention of scholars and
philosophers for many centuries now. It is sufficient at
this time to remark that the judges have done a good job of
confusing the means with the ends. The problem of business
life are better solved by pragmatism or empiricism. Once
we are cognizant that behind the premise was the policy
of inhibiting corporations, now gone or nearly so, we
shall no longer hesitate to substitute a different premise
and thus arrive at a contrary conclusion." (Villanueva,
Philippine Corporate Lauw, pp. 204, citing Government of
the Philippine Islands • El Hogar Filipino, 50 Phil. 399,
460-461 [1927/)
In actual corporate practice, this question arises: Can there
still be a corporation if there are only two incorporators who are
residents of the Philippines? Yes, provided that at least five
incorporators must sign the articles of incorporation.
Can there be a one-man corporation, one which is referred to as
a corporation but owned by only one person?
This happens when such person who owns said corporation
gives a nominal share of stock to persons of his choice. This becomes
possible when said persons are residents of the Philippines but
not citizens of the Philippines who, as owner of nominal shares of
stocks, become incorporators of the said corporation because the law

100

LEGAL FORMS
CHAPTER X
CORPORATION

requires that only a majority of the incorporators must be residents
of the Philippines. However, in instances where ownership of a
corporation is reserved by law, fully or partially, to Filipino citizens,
it is required that 60%-40% ownership rule or 100% Filipino
ownership rule should be complied with. Hence, in the exploitation
of our natural resources, 60% of the corporation must be owned by
Filipino citizens and only 40% of the corporation can be owned by
foreign capital. The same thing is true in the case of public utility
companies. However, in mass media or retail trade, the company
must be owned 100% by Filipino citizens.
An incorporator will always retain his status as the incorporator of the corporation because such status is acquired by the mere
fact of being one of the persons who originally composed the corporation. He may cease to be stockholder or a member, he may lose all his
rights and interest in the corporation, but he will always be known
as the incorporator. The Articles of Incorporation cannot therefore
be amended to delete the name of an incorporator and substitute
it with that of another, the latter not being an incorporator. (SEC
Opinion, January 7, 1974)

3.
Persons with sound mind at the time of the execution of
the will (Art. 799, NCC)
NOTE: Only natural persons, not juridical persons, can make a will.
A convict under court interdiction is allowed to make a will because
civil interdiction prohibits a disposition of property inter vivos, not
mortis causa. Spendthrifts or prodigals even if under guardianship
can make a will provided they are at least 18 years of age and are of
sound mind.
IN ORDER THAT A TESTATOR CAN BE
CONSIDERED TO BE OF SOUND MIND,
WHAT IS REQUIRED?
To be of sound mind, it is not necessary that the testator be
in full possession of all his reasoning faculties, or that his mind be
willingly unbroken, unimpaired, or unsheltered by disease, injury
or other cause.
It shall be sufficient that the testator was able at the time of
making the will:

Art. 804
Every will must be in writing and executed in a
language or dialect known to the testator.

NOTE: A person may be suffering from paralysis, loss of speech,
deafness, blindness, poor memory, but this does not mean that he is
of unsound mind at the time of the execution of the will.

Art. 805 - Every will, other than a holographic will, must
be subscribed at the end thereof by the testator himself or by the
testator's names written by some other person in his presence, and by
his express direction, and attested and subscribed by three or more
credible witnesses in the presence of the testator and of one another.

3.
NCC)

DOES THE LAW PRESUME THAT EVERY
PERSON IS OF SOUND MIND?
Yes, in the absence of proof to the contrary.
WHAT ARE THE MANIFESTATIONS OF
UNSOUNDNESS OF MIND?
Justice Edgardo L. Paras cited the following:
1.

State of delirium;

2.

printed.

sign the testator's name in the presence of the testator and the
testamentary witnesses.

ACTUALLY SEE THE WITNESSES SUBSCRIBE
THEIR NAMES TO THE INSTRUMENT?

them sign if he chose it. In such a case, it will be presumed that he
did see them sign.
WHEN THIS HAPPENS, WHAT IS REQUIRED?
The signing must take place within the testator's range of
vision, so that he may readily see what they are doing, if he is so
disposed.
IF THE TESTATOR IS DEPRIVED OF THE USE OF ANY
OF HIS FACULTIES BY MERE PHYSICAL INFIRMITYTHE TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE WILL WAS
ATTESTED IN HIS PRESENCE IS:
1.
To require whether he was conscious of the presence of
the witnesses and understood what they were doing when they
wrote their name on the will.
2.
It is also sufficient if the signatures are made, where it is
possible for each of the witnesses, if they desire to do so, to see the
signing.
ALL THE PAGES OF THE WILL MUST BE SIGNED

CONTRACT DEFINED
Article 1305 of the New Civil Code has this definition:
"A contract is a meeting of minds between two persons whereby
one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or
to render some service."

(ACKNOWLEDGMENT)

It is derived from the Latin word "contractus." Castan,
citing the Italian Civil Code, said that it is an agreement of
two or more persons for the purpose of creating, modifying, and
extinguishing a judicial relation between them.
2.

ELEMENTS OF A CONTRACT
Essential Elements They are essential because
without them a contract cannot exist, i.e., consent, subject
matter, cause or consideration.
Natural Elements They are found in certain contracts
and presumed to exist, unless the contrary has been stipulated,
i.e., warranty against hidden defects in a contract of sale.
Accidental Elements
They are called accidental
because they may be present or absent, depending upon whether
or not the parties have agreed upon them, i.e., stipulation to
pay in one year or two years, with interest.

3.

STIPULATIONS THAT MAY BE AGREED UPON
Article 1306 of the New Civil Code provides as follows:
"The contracting parties may establish such stipulations,
clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient,
provided they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs,
public order, or public policy."
139

LEGAL FORMS

140

4.

AS A RULE, CONTRACTS TAKE EFFECT ONLY AS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES, THEIR ASSIGNS AND HEIRS
EXCEPTIONS:
Except in case where the obligations arising from the
contract are not transmissible by their nature, by stipulation,
or by provision oflaw. (Art. 1311, New Civil Code)
Except if there is a STIPULATION POUR AUTRUI. (Art.
1311, ibid.)
Except if a third person induces another to violate his
contract. (Art. 1314, New Civil Code)
Except where in some cases, third persons may be
adversely affected by a contract where they did not participate.
(Art. 1312, New Civil Code)
Except where the law authorizes the creditor to sue on a
contract entered into by his debtor (accion directa). Example:
The sublessee has an obligation to the sublessor, but the
sublessee is bound to the lessor for all the acts which refer to
the use and preservation of the thing leased in the manner
stipulated between the lessor and the lessee.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Q:

What is the new law that repealed, replaced, and
codified the Philippine Trademark Law (R.A. No. 166a),
Philippine Patent Law (R.A. No. 165a), Copyright Law of
the Philippines (P.D. No. 49), Reprinting Law (P.D. No.
285) and Articles 188 and 189 of the Revised Penal Code?

A:

The Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines (R.A.
No. 8293) which took effect on January 11, 1998.

Q:

What is the protection against violations of trademarks?

A:

Trademark protections are territorial. The protection
against violation of trademark rights is limited only

LEGAL FORMS

232

within the territorial boundaries of the country where the
mark is registered.
However, where the mark involved is proven to be
a well-known one, our country is bound to recognize the
integrity of such well-known trademark.
Reasons:
l.

On account of our membership in the Paris Convention for the protection of industrial property.

2.

For as long as we are a member of such international
treaty, our country is bound to recognize the integrity
of such well-known mark.

3.

The said protection applies to trademarks, trade
names, service marks, patents, copyrights, which are
collectively known as INTELLECTUAL PROPER-

TIES.
Q:

What is the commitment of the Philippine Government as
a member/party to the Paris Convention for the protection
of Industrial Property?

A:

The Philippine Government committed itself to recognize
the right of a foreign corporation to file suit in our courts
to protect its trademark.

Q:

A:

Does a foreign corporation, not doing business in the
Philippines, need a license to sue in the Philippines for
trademark violations?
As early as 1927, in the case of Western Equipment
and Supply Company v. Reyes, 51 Phil. 115, the court
ruled that "a foreign corporation which has never
done any business in the Philippines and which is
unlicensed and unregistered to do business here, but
is widely and favorably known in the Philippines
through the use therein of its products bearing
its corporate and tradename, has a legal right to
maintain action in the Philippines to restrain the
residents and inhabitants thereof organizing a
corporation therein bearing the same name as the
foreign corporation when it appears that they have
personal knowledge of the existence of such foreign
corporation, and it is apparent that the purpose

CHAPTER XIV
COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE-NAME AND PATENT

233

of the proposed domestic corporation is to deal
and trade in the same goods as those of the foreign
corporation."
On May 21, 1984, in the case of La Chemise La Coste,
SA v. Fernandez, 129 SCRA 373-.404, our Supreme Court
ruled:
"In upholding the right of the
petitioner to maintain the present suit
before our courts for unfair competition or
infringement of trademarks of a foreign
corporation, we are moreover recognizing
our duties and the rights of foreign
states under the Paris Convention for the
Protection of Industrial property to which
Philippines and France are parties. We
are simply interpreting and enforcing a
solemn international commitment of the
Philippines embodied in a multilateral
treaty to which we are party and which we
entered into because it is in our national
interest to do so,"

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING

236

dirty, it manifests outright the kind of personality of the lawyer who
filed it. The same is true if the format of the pleading is poor and
awkward, or if the pleading is not sufficient in form and substance.

PART II
CHAPTER I

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING

PURPOSE OF PLEADINGS

The purpose of pleadings is to define the issues and form the
foundation of the proof to be submitted at the trial. They narrow the
case down to a specific issue or issues which will be submitted to the
court for trial and judgment.
LAW GOVERNING PLEADINGS

CONCEPT AND DEFINITION OF PLEADINGS

Pleadings are the written statements of the respective claims
and defenses submitted to the court for appropriate judgment. (Sec.
1, Rule 6, Revised Rules of Court)
The pleadings contain a statement of facts constituting the
cause of action or defense of the parties. In effect, a pleading advises
a party what his adversary relies on as a cause of action or as a
defense so that each party will be prepared to meet the issues
presented. The court, on the other hand, is able to know the issues
being raised and the points or matters which will be submitted at
the trial.
In a broad sense, the term "pleadings"embraces all proceedings
from the time of the filing of the complaint until the issue is joined,
or even until the termination of the proceedings (People v. Aquino,
G.R. No. L-23908, October 29, 1966), but the Rules of Court (Sec.
2, Rule 6, Revised Rules of Court) specifies the pleadings which a
party may file thus: a complaint, answer, counter-claim, cross-claim,
reply, third-party complaint, fourth-party complaint, and other
similar complaints.
IMPORTANCE OF A PLEADING

A pleading is a gauge not only of the worthiness, capability
and personality of a lawyer but also of the worthiness of the issues,
or the defenses being raised by him. If a pleading is filed with a
lot of grammatical errors, it will definitely irritate a judge or a
learned adversary who is reading it and more than this, the lawyer's
capability is already known even before the trial. If a pleading is
234

The formal and substantial requisites of a pleading are
governed by the law prevailing at the time of its filing. (Dimaisip v.
Court of Appeals, et al., L-1300, September 25, 1959)
SYSTEM OF PLEADINGS IN THE PHILIPPINES

The system of pleadings followed in this jurisdiction is called
and referred to as Code Pleading, the system used in the States of
the Union that had adopted codes of procedure. (Marquez v. Varela,
G.R. No. L-4845, December 24, 1982)
PLEADINGS MUST BE SUFFICIENT IN
FORM AND IN SUBSTANCE

When are pleadings deemed sufficient?
Pleadings are deemed sufficient when they substantially
comply with the requirements of the law as to form and substance.
When are pleadings defective in form and when are
pleadings defective in substance?
A defect in form occurs when, though enough facts are stated,
they are not stated in the manner required by law. A formal or
technical defect, however, will not invalidate a pleading which
otherwise sufficiently states a cause of action. Hence, deficiencies
in the observance of the rules and imperfections of form and
technicalities of procedure should not vitiate the pleading when
the issues are clearly stated because a case cannot be sacrificed on
mere technical points. (Co Tiamco v. Diaz, 42 O.G. 1169) All that
is expected of the pleadings is that they should give fair notice of
the material elements of plaintiffs claim and defendant's defense.

LEGAL FORMS

CHAPTER I
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING

(Page IO, Revised Rules of Court in the Philippines, citing More,
Volume I, p. 423; Keeton Trial Tactics and Methods, p. 342 /19541)
Hence, a defective caption has been held to be merely a formal defect,
and not a fatal defect. Absence of verification is likewise a formal
defect, and not a jurisdictional defect. (Miller, et al. v. Director of
Lands, et al., 12 SCRA 293; Vllarica v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
96085, March 16, 1992)

of error or injustice by exploring in the midst of uncertainty and
divining the intention of the parties or their counsel." (Go Occo and
Co. v. De La Costa, 63 Phil. 445)

236

A defect in substance occurs when a pleader fails to state
enough facts to constitute a prima facie cause of action, or a prima
facie defense. Hence, a complaint is not sufficient if it seeks judgment
on mere hypothetical questions, without any allegation of a factual
nature, or without presenting to the court an actual controversy or
dispute. A mere allegation therefore by A that B's title has a defect
which should not defeat his title. is not sufficient to constitute a
cause of action.
The test of sufficiency of a complaint is whether a competent
court could render valid judgment upon the facts alleged therein if
said facts were admitted or proved. If it could, then the allegations
are sufficient.
HOW ARE PLEADINGS CONSTRUED?

As a general rule, pleadings are liberally construed (Chua •
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 88383, February 19, 1992; Philippine
Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals, 173 SCRA 544), (1) so as to do
substantial justice, (2) so that the case shall not be sacrificed on
mere technical points (Co Tiamco v. Diaz, 42 O.G. 1169), (3) so that
the issues may be properly laid before the court (Santiago v. De Los
Santos, 61 SCRA 146), (4) so that the rights of the parties may not
be nullified (Bato Ali v. Court of First Instance of Lanao, 80 Phil.
506), (5) so that legal technicalities may be avoided (Bank of the
Philippine Islands v. Laguna Coconut Oil Co., 44 Phil. 618; Chua
v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 88383, February 19, 1992; Philippine
Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals, 173 SCRA 544), and (6) so that
the ends of justice or the law may be served. (Villarica v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 96085, March 16, 1992)
The rule on liberality, however, is not applicable in the
following cases:
1.
When the pleading is obviously vague and uncertain or
indefinite for the court lo understand what the pleader is complaining
about, the court will not allow itself to be led to "the commission

237

2.
When there are statements or matters in a pleading which
are redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous, they can be
stricken out by motion or upon the court's own initiative at any time.
(Sec. 12, Rule 9, Revised Rules of Court) 'The same is true in the
case of sham pleadings (Ibid.), or in pleadings where allegations
are intemperate or derogatory. In the words of Chief Justice Cesar
Bengzon, the use of intemperate language detracts from the force of
argument. (Lagunbay v. Commission on Elections, L-2544, January
31, 1966)
3.
When a pleading is resorted to by a party for the purpose
of delaying the proceedings of a case. (National Waterworks and
Sewerage Authority v. NWSA Consolidated Union, 28 SCRA 171)
4.
When on the basis of inadequate allegations, it appears
that the pleader is suppressing facts material to the disposition of
the case. (Orbit Trans. Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission,
et al., 58 SCRA 78)
5.
When a pleading contains allegations which are
ambiguous and evasive and they are apparently used to confuse the
plaintiff. (Sy-Quia, et al. v. Marsana, et al., 22 SCRA 926)
6.
When scandalous or indecent matters are inserted in
the pleadings, the same may be stricken out either at the court's
initiative or upon motion of the opposing counsel. (Sec. 12, Rule 9,
Revised Rules of Court)
JURISDICTIONAL ALLEGATIONS

The cause or causes of action, or the admissions or denials
and the defenses being raised by the parties must be contained in
paragraphs "so numbered as to be readily identified, each of which
shall contain a single set of circumstances so far as that can be done
with convenience. A paragraph may be referred to by a number in
all subsequent pleadings." (Sec. 2a], Rule 7, Revised Rules of Court)
When two or more causes of action are joined, the statement
of the first shall be prefaced by the words "first cause of action," of
the second by "second cause of action," and so on for the others. (Sec.
2/b], Rule 7, Revised Rules of Court)

238

LEGAL FORMS

When one or more paragraphs in the answer are addressed to
one of several causes of action in the complaint, they shall be prefaced
by the words "answer to the first cause of action" or "answer to the
second cause of action" and so on; and when one or more paragraphs
of the answer are addressed to several causes of action, they shall be
prefaced by words to that effect. (par. [bf, second sentence of Sec. 2,
Rule 7, Revised Rules of Court)

CHAPTER I
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING

239

VERIFICATION

Verification is not part of the pleading and does not vest
jurisdiction in the courts.
It is a statement under oath that the pleading is true. It secures
good faith in the averments made by a party in the pleading.
WHO MAY VERIFY A PLEADING?

PRAYER

Th.is is part of the pleading which states the relief or reliefs
prayed for by the parties. lt is not a part of the cause of action.
A single right of action may entitle plaintiff to several kinds
of relief, but it is possible that several rights of action may entitle a
party concerned to only one relief.
A prayer for relief is not indispensably or necessarily conclusive
of the sufficiency of the complaint or of the right to relief.
The relief or reliefs prayed for may be proper or not, but as long
as the plaintiff deserves a relief, the court will grant him the relief
to which he is entitled under the facts as proven. (Guidotte v. Yeung,
CA-CR No. 6268, July 10, 1951)
SIGNATURE AND ADDRESS

Pleadings must be signed by the party or his attorney.
Subscribing to a pleading by one who is neither a party nor an
attorney is irregular and may be rejected.
A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign his
pleading and state his address. (Sec. 3, Rule 7, Revised Rules of
Court) However, a mark made by a party unable to write his name is
sufficient. (Notes and Comments, Martin, p. 309, Volume I, Second
Edition)
The address of the lawyer should be properly indicated in his
pleading because court notices and pleadings of the opposing counsel
are served to him, and not to his client.
The signature of the lawyer constitutes a certificate by him
that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge
information and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it
is not interposed for delay. (Second sentence, Sec. 3, Rule 7, Revised
Rules of Court)

Verification may be made by the party, his representative,
lawyer or any person who personally knows the truth of the facts
alleged in the pleadings. Where the verification is made by the
attorney who also signed the pleadings, the courts are inclined to be
liberal and accept substantial compliance with the verification rule.
(Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium, Vol. I, citing Arambulo v.
Perez, 78 Phil. 387; Matel w. Rosal, L-7095, April 25, 1955; Cajete v.
Fernandez, etc., et al., 109 Phil. 743)
VERIFICATION BASED ON "KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF"

A pleading required to be verified which contains a verification
based on "information and belief," or upon "knowledge, information
and belief," or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as
an unsigned pleading. (par. 3, Sec. 4, Rule 7, 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure)
SHOULD ALL PLEADINGS BE VERIFIED?

Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule,
pleadings need not be under oath, verified or accompanied by
affidavit. (Sec. 4, Rule 7, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure)

(Designation of the crime committed)

Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure state the formal parts of a pleading, thus:
Section I. Caption The caption sets forth the name
of the court, the title of the action, and the docket number if
assigned.
The title of the action indicates the names of the parties.
They shall all be named in the original complaint or petition;
but in subsequent pleadings, it shall be sufficient if the name
of the first party on each side be stated with an appropriate
indication when there are other parties.
Their respective participation in the case shall be indicated.
(1a, 2a)
Section 2. ~ - The body of the pleading sets forth
its designation, the allegations of the party's claims or defenses,
the relief prayed for, and the date of the pleading. (n)
(a) Paragraphs - The allegations in the body of a
pleading shall be divided into paragraphs so numbered as to
be readily identified, each of which shall contain a statement
of a single set of circumstances so far as that can be done with
convenience. A paragraph may be referred to by its number in
all succeeding pleadings.
(b) Headings When two or more causes of action are
joined, the statement of the first shall be prefaced by the words

LEGAL FORMS

246

"first cause of action," of the second by "second cause of action,"
and so on for the others.
When one or more paragraphs in the answer are addressed
to one of several causes of action in the complaint they shall be
prefaced by the words "answer to the first cause of action" or
"answer to the second cause of action" and so on; and when
one or more paragraphs of the answer are addressed to several
causes of action, they shall be prefaced by words to that effect.
(4)
(c) Relief- The pleading shall specify the relief sought,
but it may add a general prayer for such further or other relief
as may be deemed just or equitable. (3a, R6)
(d)

Date Every pleading shall be dated. (n)

Section 3. Signature and Address Every pleading
must be signed by the party or counsel representing him, stating
in either case his address which should not be a post office box.
The signature of counsel constitutes a certificate by him
that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge,
information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and
that it is not interposed for delay.
An unsigned pleading produces no legal effect. However, the
court may, in its discretion, allow such deficiency to be remedied
if it shall appear that the same was due to mere inadvertence
and not intended for delay. Counsel who deliberately files an
unsigned pleading, or signs a pleading in violation of this Rule,
or alleges scandalous or indecent matter therein, or fails to
promptly report to the court a change of his address, shall be
subject to appropriate disciplinary action. (6a)
Section 4. Verification
Except when otherwise
specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under
oath, verified or accompanied by affidauit. (5a)
A pleading is verified by an affidavit that the affiant has
read the pleading and that the allegations therein are true and
correct of his knowledge and belief.
A pleading required to be verified which contains a
verification based on "information and belief," or upon
"knowledge, information and belief," or lacks a proper
uerification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading. (6a)

CHAPTER I
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PLEADING

247

Section 5. Certification against forum shopping
- The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in
the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim
for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and
simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore
commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same
issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the
best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending
therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a
complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he
should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim
has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five
(5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint
or initiatory pleading has been filed.
Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall
not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other
initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the
case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion
and after hearing. The submission of a false certification or
non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall
constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to
the corresponding administrative and criminal actions. If
the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful
and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for
summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct
contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions. (n)"
Verifications based on "information and belief," shall be
deemed insufficient.

possession is open, public and

held to be sufficient. The specific

matters of evidence which could
be proved at the trial.

CHAPTER II

ALLEGATIONS IN A PLEADING
WHAT ARE CONTAINED IN A PLEADING?

Section 1, Rule 8 of the Revised Rules of Court in the Philippines
answers this question. It provides as follows:
"Section I. In General
Every pleading shall contain
in a methodical and logical form, a plain, concise and direct
statement of the ultimate facts on which the party pleading
relies for his claim or defense, as the case may be, omitting the
statement of mere evidentiary facts.
If a defense relied on is based on law, the pertinent
provisions thereof and their applicability to him shall be clearly
and concisely stated." (n)
DISTINCTION BETW EEN ULTIMATE AND
EVIDENTIARY FACTS

249

WHAT ARE THOSE THAT NEED NOT BE
ALLEGED IN THE PLEADING?

The following need not be alleged:
1.

Details of probative matter or particulars of evidence;

2.

Statements of law, inferences and arguments;

3.

Conclusiveness of law;

4.

Facts of which are of judicial cognizance; and

and himself have been in peace248

How many claims can a plaintiff have in one complaint?
The plaintiff may set forth in his complaint only a single claim,
and this may be stated in one paragraph or more.
The plaintiff may also set forth two or more claims as he has
and may demand relief in the alternative. (Sec. 2, Rule 8, Revised
Rules of Court)
How many defenses can a defendant have in his answer?
The defendant may set forth as many defenses and counterclaims he may have.
The defendant may set up negative defenses in one answer and
affirmative defenses in another in the same action.
The defendant cannot be denied the right to set up numerous
defenses. The failure of the defendant to prove one defense shall

LEGAL FORMS

250

CHAPTER II
ALLEGATIONS IN A PLEADING

not preclude him from proving another defense which is equally
sufficient to defeat the action of the plaintiff.
A GENERA L AVERMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE
OR OCCURRENCE OF ALL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT
IS SUFFICIENT (Sec. 3, Rule 8)

Although a general averment of performance or occurrence of
a condition precedent is sufficient, the plaintiff whose right of action
depends upon it, should set forth and prove the fulfillment of the
condition or the legal excuse for its non-fulfillment. (Government of
P.I. w. Inchausti and Co., 24 Phil. 315) This is an essential allegation
and the failure to allege this renders the complaint defective, and
it may even be dismissed, upon motion, for lack of cause of action.
(Iohuston Lumber Co. v. Court of Tax Appeals)
CAPACITY

Section 4, Rule 8 of the Revised Rules of Court provides as
follows:
"Section 4. Capacity Facts showing the capacity of
a party to sue or to be sued or the authority of a party to sue
or be sued in a representative capacity or the legal existence
of an organized association of persons that is made a party,
must be averred. A party desiring to raise an issue as to the
legal existence of any party or the capacity of any party to sue
or be sued in a representative capacity, shall do so by specific
denial, which shall include such supporting particulars as are
peculiarly within the pleader's knowledge." (4)
Facts or allegations showing capacity may be attacked but
this can only be done by specific denial supported by particulars
particularly within the knowledge of the pleader. Failure to do so
either in the answer or in the motion to dismiss, amounts to a waiver
of the said objection.
FRA UD, MISTAKE, CONDITION OF THE MIND

In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances
constituting fraud or mistake must be stated with particularity.
Malice, intent, knowledge or other condition of mind of a person may
be averred generally. (Sec. 5, Rule 8, Revised Rules of Court)

251

While circumstances constituting fraud or mistake must
be pleaded with particularity, the complaint must set forth only
ultimate facts, and should not plead evidentiary matters. However
since it is hard to state the particulars constituting malice, intent,
knowledge or some other condition of the mind of a person, it shall
sufficient to allege the same generally without setting out the
circumstances from which it is to be inferred.

Defendant, however, informed the plaintiff that he cannot
deliver to the plaintiff the entire one thousand (1,000) cavans of
Dinorado rice and that all he has in his rice mill was only fifty (50)

10. Defendant is evidently guilty of bad faith in refusing to
return the amount paid by the plaintiff without even giving any
valid or justifiable reason, which caused the latter mental anguish,
serious anxiety, moral shock and other similar injury, for which the
defendant should be held liable to pay P100,000 as moral damages.
11. By way of example or correction for the public good, and to
deter other like-minded individuals from trampling upon the rights
of others, defendant should likewise be held liable to pay Pl00,000
as nominal damages.
12. As a result of defendant's wanton refusal to return the
amount paid by the plaintiff and to rescind their earlier agreement,
plaintiff was compelled to litigate and for the purpose, have to engage
the services of the undersigned law firm for a fee of P50,000.00.

ANSWER

WHAT IS AN ANSWER?

FORM NO. 124, ANSWER WITH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES

An answer is a pleading in which a defending party sets forth
his defenses. (Sec. 4, Rule 6)

(CLAUSES)

Said defenses may be negative or affirmative:
a.
Negative Defense
A negative defense is the
specific denial of the material fact or facts alleged in the
pleading of the claimant essential to his cause or causes of
action. (Sec. 5, Rule 6)
b.
Affirmative Defense
An affirmative defense
is an allegation of a new matter which, while hypothetically
admitting the material allegations in the pleading of the
claimant, would nevertheless prevent or bar recovery by him.
The affirmative defenses include fraud, statute of limitations,
release, payment, illegality, statute of frauds, estoppel, former
recovery, discharge in bankruptcy, and any other matter by
way of confession and avoidance. (Sec. 5/b}, Rule 6)

Based on the foregoing affirmative allegations, the
Promissory Note signed by the defendant, unaccompanied by the
requisite Disclosure Statement, is of no force and effect.

Moreover, since the signing thereof was attended with
fraud, duress, intimidation, threat, and undue influence, the same
is void from its inception.

That since the penalties and liquidated damages are
iniquitous and unconscionable, the courts, under the circumstances,
can reduce the penalties and liquidated damages, pursuant to
Articles 1229 and 2227 of the Civil Code, which provisions state:

EXAMPLE OF DIFFERENT AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES
1.

"ART. 1229. The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty
when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly
complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no
performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it
is iniquitous or unconscionable."

shall be published in a newspaper or general circulation.
However, no extrajudicial settlement shall be binding
upon any person who has not participated or had no
notice thereof.

SUMMARY SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE WHOSE
GROSS VALUE IS P10,000.00 OR LESS

SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSONS
(a)

EXTRAJUDICIAL SETTLEMENT BY
AGREEMENT OF THE HEIRS

There can only be summary settlement of estate if the gross
value of the same is P 10,000.00 or less. If this requirement
is complied with, the heirs may apply to the competent court,
after the regular publication, to proceed with the summary
partition and after paying all the known obligations, to
partition all the property among the heirs, without appointing
an administrator.
a.

Competent Court: Refers to the Court of First Instance
having jurisdiction of the estate (CFI before is now
referred to as RTC);

b.

Publication: The notice about the said summary
settlement shall be published once a week for three
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation
in the province where the property is situated;

c.

Hearing: The hearing shall be held not less than one
month or more than three months from the date of last
publication of notice.

This remedy has several requisites, to wit:
(a)

The decedent left no will;

(b)

The decedent left no debts (this is presumed if no creditor
files a petition within two years after the death of the
deceased) (Last sentence of Sec. 1, Rule 74),

(c)

A public instrument should be filed with the Register of
Deeds;

(d)

All the heirs must be of age, or if they are minors,
they should be represented by their judicial or legal
representatives duly authorized for the purpose;

(e)

All the said heirs must agree. If the heirs disagree, the
heirs may do so through an ordinary action of partition
(Sec. I, Rule 74);

309

2.

There can only be summary settlement regardless of whether
the deceased person died with or without a will provided that
the gross value of his estate does not exceed Pl0,000.00 or less.

CHAPTER III
JUDICIAL FORMS

(b)

There is no prescriptive period for institution of probate
proceedings because the same is established not primarily
for the interest of the heirs but principally to protect the
expressed wishes of the testator;

(c)

The probate of a will is conclusive as to its due execution
and as to the testamentary capacity of the testator but
not as to the validity of any provisions made in the will.
Hence, after a will has been probated by a competent
court, the law will not admit evidence to overthrow the
legal presumption that it is genuine.

LEGAL FORMS

CHAPTER III
JUDICIAL FORMS

Subject to the right of appeal, the allowance of the will, either
during the lifetime of the testator or after his death, shall be
conclusive as to its due execution. (Art. 838, Civil Code)

(8) PROOF OF HOLOGRAPHIC WILL - In the case of
a holographic will, it shall be necessary that at least one witness
who knows the handwriting and signature of the testator explicitly
declare that the will and the signature arc in the handwriting of the
testator. In the absence of any competent witness, and if the court
deem it necessary, expert testimony may be resorted to. (Rule 76,
Sec. 5, par. 2, Rules of Court; see also Art. 81 l, Civil Code)

318

(3) CONTENTS OF PETITION A petition for allowance
of a will must show, so far as known to the petitioner:
(a)

The jurisdictional facts;

(b)

The names, ages, and residences of the heirs,
legatees, and devisees of the decedent;

(c)

The probable value and character of the property of
the estate;

(d)

The name of the person for whom letters are prayed;

(e)

If the will has not been delivered to the court, the
name of the person having custody of it.

But no defect in the petition shall render void the allowance of
the will, or the issuance of letters testamentary or of administration
with the will annexed. (Rule 76, Sec. 2, Rules of Court)
(4)

For the proper venue;

(5) As to the presumption of death of person for purposes of
settlement of his estate;
(6) PROCESS - In the exercise of probate jurisdiction,
Courts of First Instance may issue warrants and process necessary
to compel the attendance of witnesses or to carry into effect their
orders and judgments, and all other powers granted them by law. If
a person does not perform an order or judgment rendered by a court
in the exercise of its probate jurisdiction, it may issue a warrant
for the apprehension and imprisonment of such person until he
performs such order or judgment, or is released. (Rule 73, Sec. 3,
Rules of Court)
(7) PROOF AT HEARING WHAT SUFFICIENT IN
ABSENCE OF CONTEST - At the hearing compliance with
the provisions of the last two preceding sections must be shown
before the introduction of testimony in support of the will. All such
testimony shall be taken under oath and reduced to writing. If no
person appears to contest the allowance of the will, the court may
grant allowance thereof on the testimony of one of the subscribing
witnesses only, if such witness testifies that the will executed as is
required by law. (Rule 76, Sec. 5, par. 1, Rules of Court)

319

(9) PROOF WHEN WITNESSES DO NOT RESIDE IN
PROVINCE
IR it appears at the time fixed for the hearing that
none of the subscribing witnesses resides in the province, but that
the deposition of one or more of them can be taken elsewhere, the
court may, on motion, direct it to be taken, and may authorize a
photographic copy of the will to be made and to be presented to the
witness on his examination, who maybe asked the same questions
with respect to it, and to the handwriting of the testator and others,
as would be pertinent and competent if the original will were
present. (Rule 76, Sec. 7, Rules of Court)

(10) PROOF WHEN WITNESSES DEAD OR INSANE OR
DO NOT RESIDE IN THE PHILIPPINES - If it appears at the
time fixed for the hearing that the subscribing witnesses are dead
or insane, or that none of them resides in the Philippines, the court
may admit the testimony of other witnesses to prove the sanity of
the testator, and the due execution of the will; and as evidence of the
execution of the will, it may admit proof of the handwriting of the
testator and of the subscribing witnesses, or any of them. (Rule 76,
Sec. 8, Rules of Court)
(11) SUBSCRIBING WITNESSES PRODUCED OR ACCOUNTED FOR WHERE CONTESTED - If the will is contested, all the subscribing witnesses, and the notary in the case of wills
executed under the Civil Code of the Philippines, if present in the
Philippines and not insane, must be produced and examined, and
the death, absence or insanity of any of them must be satisfactorily
shown to the court. If all or some of the witnesses are present in the
Philippines but outside the province where the will has been filed,
their deposition must be taken. If any or all of them testify against
the due execution of the will, or do not remember having attested to
it; or are otherwise of doubtful credibility, the will may, nevertheless, be allowed if the court is satisfied from the testimony of other
witnesses and from all the evidence presented that the will was executed and attested in the manner required by law.
If a holographic will is contested, the same shall be allowed
if at least three witnesses who know the handwriting of the

Article VII, Sec. 9

"Section9
The President shall be Commander-inChief of all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever
it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to
prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection,
or rebellion. In case of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or
imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he
may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place
the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law."
1987 CONSTITUTION

5.
That it will serve the public welfare, as well as the welfare

HABEAS CORPUS

This is a writ directed to a person detaining another and
commanding him to produce the body of the prisoner at a certain
time and place and to state the cause of his capture and detention.
Habeas corpus is a remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint.

Article VII, Sec. 18

"Section 18 - The President shall be Commander-inChief of all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it
becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent
or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of
invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may,
for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days, suspend the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part
thereof under martial law."
2.
Supreme Court rulings on the issue of whether or not the
courts can inquire on the presidential suspension of the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus are as follows:
The first two leading cases on this point are the cases of Barcelon v. Baker, 5 Phil. 87 and Montenegro v. Castaneda, 91 Phil. 88. In

334

LEGAL FORMS

both cases, the Supreme Court decided that the President's decision
to suspend privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is "final and conclusive upon the courts and all other persons."
The Barcelon rule was enunciated in this juriscliction in 1905
whereas the Montenegro rule, which reiterated the Barcelon rule,
was enunciated in 1952. This ruling continued to prevail until 1971
when our Supreme Court came out with another ruling in the case
of Lansang v. Garcia, 42 SCRA 448.
In the said case of Lansang v. Garcia, the Supreme Court ruled
that courts are allowed to inquire whether or not a presidential
suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is arbitrary
in order to determine its constitutional sufficiency.
The Lansang doctrine, however, was abandoned on account
of the decision rendered by the Supreme Court in cases docketed
as G.R. No. 61388 entitled "In the Matter of Dra. Aurora Parong,
et al., Josefina Garcia-Padilla, petitioner us. Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile, Gen. Fabian Ver, Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, and Lt. Col. Miguel
Coronel, respondents" decided on April 20, 1983, and G.R. No. 61016
entitled "In the Matter of the Petition for Habeas Corpus of Horace R.
Morales, Jr., petitioner us. Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, Gen. Fabian
C. Ver, Col. Galileo Kintanar, respondents," promulgated on April
26, 1983, or 6 days after the Padilla decision was promulgated.
In the Padilla case, nine justices voted to abandon the doctrine
in the Lansang case and these justices are as follows: Justice Pacifico
de Castro, Efren Plana, Juvenal Guerrero, Felix Makasiar, Venecia
Escolin, Conrado Vasquez, Vicente Abad Santos, Hugo Gutierrez,
Jr., and Lorenzo Relova. Two justices voted to retain the doctrine in
the Lansang case and they are Chief Justice Enrique Fernando and
Justice Claudio Teehankee.
The majority decision reverted to the Barcelon and Montenegro
rule, as above-mentioned.
In the Morales case, the justices who previously voted in the
Padilla case in favor of abandoning the doctrine in the Lansang
case maintained their position. Three justices voted to retain the
Lansang doctrine and they are Chief Justice Enrique Fernando and
Justices Claudio Teehankee and Hermogenes Concepcion.
3.
Now, under Section 18, Article VII of the new Constitution,
the military powers of the President are more defined and specific.

335

The original authority of the Commander-in-Chief, as provided in
the 1973 Constitution, is changed as follows:
(a)

He may call out the armed forces to prevent or suppress
lawless violence, invasion or rebellion only;

(b)

The grounds for the suspension of the privilege of the writ
of habeas corpus and the proclamation of martial law are
now limited only to invasion or rebellion;

(c)

The duration of such suspension or proclamation shall not
exceed 60 days, following which it shall be automatically
lifted;

(d)

Within 48 hours after such suspension or proclamation,
the President shall personally or in writing report his
action to Congress;

(e)

The Congress may then, by a majority vote of all its
members voting jointly, revoke his action. The revocation
may not be set aside by the President;

(D)

By the same vote and in the same manner, the Congress
may, upon the initiative of the President, extend his
suspension or proclamation for a period to be determined
by the Congress if the invasion or rebellion shall continue
and the public safety requires the extension;

(g)

The action of the President and Congress shall be subject
to review by the Supreme Court which shall have the
authority to determine the sufficiency of the factual
basis of such action. This matter is no longer considered
a political question and may be raised in an appropriate
proceeding by any citizen. Moreover, the Supreme Court
must decide the challenge within 30 days from the time it
is fled;

(h)

Martial law does not automatically suspend the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus or the operation of the
Constitution. The civil courts and the legislative bodies
shall remain open. Military courts and agencies are not
conferred jurisdiction over civilians where the civil courts
are functioning;

(i)

The suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
shall apply only to persons facing charges of rebellion or
offenses inherent or directly connected with invasion; and

(j)

An.v person arrested for such offense must be judicially
charged therewith within three days. Otherwise, he shall
be released.

4.
A brief background of Supreme Court rulings on the
issue of whether there is right to bail during the suspension of the
privilege of the said writ arc as follows:
Garcia Padilla v. Enrile
G.R. No. 61388
The right to bail cannot be invoked during the suspension of
the privilege of habeas corpus. Associate Justices Pacifico P. De
Castro who wrote the Padilla decision for the court reasoned out in
this vein:
"Realistically, a person engaged in the rebellion does not,
upon being arrested or captured, cease to be as committed to the
cause of the movement. Through a grand conspiracy as is of the
essence of how rebellion is committed involving a great mass of
confederates bound together by a common goal, he remains in
a state of continued participation in the criminal act or design.
His heart still beats with the same emotion for the success of the
movement of which he continues to be an ardent adherent and
ally.
It is simple logic then to hold that there should be no legal
compulsion for a captured rebel to be charged in court, only to
be released on bail, while he is, realistically and legally, still
as much engaged in carrying on actively to attain their goal of
over-throwing the established regime."
"It is, likewise, all to well-known that when the rebel forces
capture government troopers or kidnap private individuals, they
do not accord to them any of the rights now being demanded by
the herein petitioners, particularly to be set at liberty upon the
filing of bail. As a matter of common knowledge, captives of
the rebels or insurgents are not only not given the right to be
released, but also denied trial of any kind. In some instances,
they may even be liquidated unceremoniously. What is then
sought by the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus, is, among others, to put the government forces on equal
fighting terms with the rebels, by authorizing the detention of
heir own rebel or dissident captives as the rebellion goes on.
In this way, the advantage the rebellion forces have over those

337

of the government, as when they resort to guerrilla tactics
with sophisticated weapons, is, at least minimized, thereby
enhancing the latter's chances of beating their enemy. It would,
therefore, seem to be ignoring realities in the name of misplaced
magnanimity and compassion, and for the sake of humanity, to
grant the demand for respect of rights supposedly guaranteed
by the Constitution by those who themselves seek to destroy that
very same instrument, trampling over it already as they are still
waging war against the government. This stark actuality gives
added force and substance to the rationale of the suspension of
the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in case of invasion,
insurrection, rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when
public safety requires it."
5.
In a book I have written, entitled "What Is Our Right
and What ls Our Power as a People," I expressed my dissent to the
above-mentioned ruling in this manner:
On the issue of bail, the two reasons given by Associate
Justice Pacifico P. de Castro and which are quoted above, are
not, in my honest opinion, sufficient justifications to deny the
right to bail for the following reasons:
First: In G.R. No. 60388 entitled "In the Matter of the
Petition for the Issuance of the Writ of Habeas Corpus for Dra.
Aurora Parong, et al., Josefina Garcia-Padilla, petitioner us.
Minister Juan Ponce Enrle, Gen. Fabian C. Ver, Gen. Fidel
V. Ramos, and Lt. Col. Miguel Coronel, respondents," records
show that Dr. Aurora Parong is charged with the crime of
illegal possession of firearms. This is clearly a bailable offense.
The same thing is true with respect to the other detainees.
No amount of legal nicety nor the issuance of a Presidential
Commitment Order can prevail over a clear constitutional
guarantee expressed in Section 18, Article IV of the New
Constitution which reads:
"SECTION 18, All persons, except those
charged with capital offenses when evidence
of
guilt is strong, shall. before_conviction, be bailable
by sufficient sureties. Excessive bail shall not be
required." (Underscoring Supplied)
Since it is clear that the said detainee is charged with
a bailable offense and since it is clear from the above-quoted
constitutional provision that she is qualified to be bailable,

338

LEGAL FORMS

CHAPTER llI
JUDICIAL FORMS

there should be no reason nor any barrier to deny the petition
for bail.
Second: While the President has the power to suspend the
privilege of habeas corpus under and by virtue of the exceptions
in Section 15, Article IV of the New Constitution, it is, on the
other hand, the power of the courts to grant bail to qualified
persons not falling under the exceptions mentioned in Section
18, Article IV. I see no justification to the statement that "the
duty of the judiciary to protect individual rights must yield
to the power of the executive to protect the state xx." Ten or
one hundred detention prisoners, or even more, even granting
that they are rebels, cannot overwhelm the vast powers of the
government. It will not make a serious difference if they are
granted the right to bail. Besides, why should the judiciary yield
a power and a duty which is appropriately its own? Moreover,
it is not the particular right of the individual that is protected
or being protected. Rather, it is the doctrine of separation of
powers itself and the system of checks and balances as well as
the very constitution itself which guarantees all of these that the
judiciary protects. If in the exercise of this duty, an individual
or group of individuals are directly or indirectly benefited,
it is because they are part and parcel of the state and of the
government which they have chosen. After all, the government
may come and go at any time but the people who compose the
state remains. They are actually the ones who work to no end so
that the nation and the state can survive.
Third: In all criminal prosecution, the accused shall be
presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy
the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of
the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a
speedy, impartial and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to
face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance
of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf. rxx"
(Sec. 19, Art. IV, New Constitution) (Underscoring Supplied)
If one's right to bail is denied, the above-quoted constitutional
right will be defeated and rendered useless. The detainee, for as
long as he is detained, cannot effectively prepare his case and his
defense. Added to this is the fact that during the entire period of
his detention and until the case is finally decided, he is, in the
eyes of the law, still presumed innocent. The contrary has yet to
be proven and yet during the interregnum between the inquiry
and the final judgment, he has already lost the battle. Even

339

before the trial starts, he is already in a very disadvantageous
position. While the government, with all the powers and
facilities in its command, is thoroughly preparing its case
and its evidence, the detainee suffers the physical and mental
burden of being kept inside the prison cell. Even granting for
the sake of argument that he is given a chance to confer with his
counsel, the disadvantage in any respect still works against the
detainee. This is very evident and clear and any contradiction
of reality will only make the truth very obvious.

For simplification, the hierarchy of authority in the disposition
and resolution of labor cases filed in the National Labor Relations
(NLRC) is as follows:

The motion for reconsideration of the decision/order/resolution
shall be entertained.

A. THE FIRST LEVEL OF AUTHORITY

B. THE SECOND LEVEL OF AUTHORITY

Cases falling within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter
(i.e. ULP or unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, money claims
exceeding P5,000.00, claims for moral, exemplary and other forms
of damages arising from employer-employee relationship, cases
involving the legality of strikes and lockouts), start at the level of
the Labor Arbiters.

The party appealing the decision of the Labor Arbiter may
also do so within 10 calendar days from receipt of the decision/
award/order by filing an appeal in the form of a Memorandum of
Appeal to the NLRC which shall state the grounds relied upon and
the arguments in support thereof, the reliefs prayed for and with a
statement of the date the appellant received the decision or award.

The complaint is filed by the complainant, assisted by counsel,

the NLRC. After the initial hearing, the respondent is given the
opportunity to file a Position paper to explain his/her/its side and
the defenses. The complainant will also be given a change to file his/
her Position Paper.

Note that the Memorandum of Appeal should comply with the
following requisites:

In actual practice, possible amicable settlement of cases takes
place, either at the initiative of the parties, or of the labor arbiters.
When the same succeeds, the cases are terminated at once without
further formalities. When the cases are not amicably settled, the
case will be submitted for resolution of the labor arbiter on the basis
of the respective position papers of the parties.
Pursuant to Article 223 of the Labor Code, as amended, and
under Section 1, Rule VI of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedures,
"decisions, awards or orders of the labor arbiter shall be final and
executory unless appealed to the Commission by any of the parties
within ten (I 0) calendar days from receipt thereof."

on Certiorari, copy furnished to the Court of Appeals and the
respondents, and simultaneously filed the required docket and other
fees for this petition.

The petitioner filed a Special Civil Action for Certiorari under
Rule 65 of the New Rules Court of Appeals on the ground of grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction,
but again, the latter disregarded the overwhelming evidence of
petitioner, including the sworn certification of the tax withheld
forms filed by the private respondent's bank with the BIR long
before the case was filed.

III.

The petitioner moved for reconsideration of the Court of
Appeal's dismissal, but again, it was dismissed by the latter.
Hence, this Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the New Riles

BY THE PROVINCIAL PROSECUTOR

EXAMPLE:

382

THIS REFERS TO CASES OF ABDUCTION,
SEDUCTION, RAPE, ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS, ADULTERY, AND CONCUBINAGE
Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code provides as follows:
Article 344. Prosecution of the crimes of adultery,
concubinage, seduction, rape and acts of lasciviousness.
The
crimes of adultery and concubinage shall not be prosecuted
except upon a complaint filed by the by the offended spouse.
The offended party cannot institute the criminal
prosecution without including both the guilty parties, if they
are both alive, nor, in any case, if he shall have consented or
pardoned the offenders.
The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts of
lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint
filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or
guardian, nor, in any case, if the offended, has been expressly
pardoned by the above named persons, as the case may be.
In cases of seduction, abduction, acts of lasciviousness and
rape, the marriage of the offender with the offended party shall
extinguish the criminal action or remit the penalty already
imposed upon him. The provisions of this paragraph shall also
be applicable to the co-principals, accomplices and accessories
after the fact of the above-mentioned crimes.
Article 344 was not enacted for the specific purpose of benefitting
the accused. The complaint required in Article 344 is merely a
condition precedent to the exercise by the proper authorities of the
power to prosecute the guilty parties. (Valdepenas v. People, L-20687,
16 SCRA 871) What is meant is that it is the complaint that starts
the prosecutory proceeding. It is not the complaint which confers
jurisdiction on the court to try the case. The court's jurisdiction is
vested in it by the Judiciary Act. (Gregorio, 2008 Edition, p. 1045)

ANSWER: The phrase "except upon a complaint fled by the

not mean that the offended party has the right to sign the people's
pleading. It simply means that the prosecutors should not file any

I. LAND REGISTRATION

IN ANCIENT TIMES, THERE WAS NO SYSTEM OF
HAVING LANDS COVERED BY TITLES

People then were nomads who were not staying in one place.
They were transferring from one place to another. They kept on
choosing the place they prefer for themselves and their families.
They did not have any concept of ownership in land until they came
to discover some advantages brought about, for instance, by the
fertility of the soil that contributed to their harvests, by the wealth
of the forests which enabled them to have abundance of fruits and
vegetables to eat, by the vastness of the sea and the rivers that
surrounded them and which gave them abundant products of the
sea.
These realities led them to realize to stay in one place for a
longer time until they established their homes, their possession
and ownership of the lands and houses they built in the lands they
occupied.
In the middle of the 11th century, titles to land in England
were vested in William the Conqueror. The rule then was that
private land ownerships or title emanate from the State.
During the period of Spanish rule in the Philippines,
private land titles could only be acquired by purchase or by the
various methods of land grant from the government. The system
of registration then was through the Spanish Mortgage law which
continued and was observed in the Philippines for a long time. This
was abrogated by P.D. No. 892 issued on February 17, 1976.
SYSTEMS OF REGISTRATION IN THE PHILIPPINES

Brief Background:
We used to have three systems of registration of land titles and
deeds, namely:
1.

The System under the Spanish Mortgage Law

2.

'The Torrens System

389

The System of recording for unregistered Lands

However, by virtue of P.D. No. 892 issued on February 16,
1976, the system of registration under the Spanish Mortgage Law
was abolished.
To simplify and streamline land registration proceedings,
P.D. No. 1529 was issued on June 11, 1978, otherwise known as
the PROPERTY REGISTRATION DECREE, governing registration
of lands under the Torrens system as well as the recording of
transactions relating to unregistered lands, including chattel
mortgages. This Decree consolidates, in effect, all pre-existing laws
on property registration with such appropriate modifications as are
called for by existing circumstances.
ADVANTAGE OF TORRENS SYSTEM
OF REGISTRATION

Under this system, the rights acquired by the registration
are guaranteed by the President, through which the government
provided an assurance fund. This fund is available to pay for
damages that may be suffered by the registrant on account of the
operation of the Land Registration Act.
REGISTRATION UNDER THE LAND REGISTRATION ACT
(ACT 496) - The idea under Act 496 is to bring more lands under
the protection of the Torrens System. Later, the following laws were
enacted:
1.

Act 2259, known as the Cadastral Act

2.
Commonwealth Act 141, known also as the Public
Land Act
Under said laws, a Torrens title is conclusive against
the whole world, including the government, and to the holder
thereof in good faith, it is guaranteed to be indefeasible,
unassailable and imprescriptible.
3.
The other system of recording is governed by
Section 194 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended
by Act 3344. (This law provided for registration or recording
of transactions, affecting unregistered lands. HOWEVER. BY
VIRTUE OF PD. NO. 892, INSTRUMENTS AFFECTING
TITLE OR RIGHTS TO LANDS RECOGNIZED OR
REGISTRABLE UNDER THE SPANISH MORTGAGE

LAW MAY MEANWHILE BE RECORDED UNDER ACT
3344, BUT ONLY WITHIN A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS
FROM FEBRUARY 16, 1976. This system of registration
does not afford the registrant absolute protection. Reason:
Because by express provision of Act 3344, any right recorded
thereafter SHALL YIELD TO ANY THIRD PERSON WITH
BETTER RIGHT.
Purpose of Registration:
1.
To afford some means of publicity so that persons dealing
with property may search the records and thereby acquire security
against instruments the execution of which have not been revealed.
2.
To maintain a permanent record of land holdings in order
to prevent fraudulent claims to lands by concealment of transfers.

Under the Torrens System, for
the purpose of obtaining registration of the land, the owner
therein is required to apply
with the proper court, and if the
court after hearing finds that
the applicant has title proper
for registration, it will be so entered to bind the land and quite
title thereto. The Commission
on Land Registration issues the
court's finding decree on the
prescribed form "ORIGINAL
REGISTRATION TITLE."

391

When the property which is
originally registered becomes
the subject of sale, mortgage,
lease, or other registrable
transaction, the instrument evidencing the transaction is filed
directly with the Registration
of Deeds of the place where the
land lies for registration.

3.
The purchaser of land is charged with notice of every fact
which an examination of the record would have disclosed.

REGISTRATION COULD NOT MAKE A DOCUMENT
VALID IF IT IS INVALID OR LEGALLY DEFECTIVE

4.
To notify and protect the interest of strangers to a given
transaction.

If the document which is registered is invalid or legally
defective, registration will not in any way render it valid or cure its
defect.

5.
Under the rule of notice, the purchaser of a property
has examined every instrument of record affecting the title. He
is charged with notice of every fact which an examination of the
record would have disclosed. THIS PRESUMPTION CANNOT BE
OVERCOME BY PROOF OF INNOCENCE OR GOOD FAITH.
THIS RULE IS ABSOLUTE. Any variation would lead to endless
confusion and useless litigation. (PNB v. Court of Appeals, et al.,
G.R. No. L-49011, dated January 22, 1980, 95 SCRA 380)
DISTINCTION: ORIGINAL REGISTRATION

When the right of ownership or
title to land is made of record

existing systems of registration,
what is accomplished is what

II. NATURALIZATION
ATTRIBUTES OF NATURA LIZATION

1) The opportunity of an alien to become a citizen by
naturalization is only a matter of grace, favor or privilege extended
to him by the State. It is not a matter of right. (Kim v. Republic,
L-6894, April 27, 1955)
2) The only right which an alien has to become a citizen is
that which is conferred on him by statute, and to acquire this right
he must strictly comply with all of the statutory conditions and
requirements. (Lee Ng Lim v. Republic, L-20151, March 31, 1965)
3)
Naturalization demands allegiance to our Constitution,
our laws and government. (Sec. 11, CA 473, as amended)
4)
The conditions for naturalization are laid down by
Congress. Courts cannot change or modify them. (Bautista v.

JURAT
TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING RULES
AND COURT RULINGS
1.
A natural-born Filipino, who also possesses American
Citizenship having been born of an American father and a Filipino
mother, IS EXEMPT from the twin requirements of swearing to
an Oath of Allegiance and executing a Renunciation of Foreign
Citizenship under the Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act
(R.A. No. 9225) before running for public office.
The Supreme Court held that Tambunting possesses dual
citizenship. Because of the circumstances of his birth, it was no
longer necessary for Tambunting to undergo the naturalization

process to American citizenship. The fact that Tambunting had dual
citizenship did not disqualify him from running for public office.

subsequently discovered that the applicant obtained it by misleading
the court upon any material fact. Availment of a tax amnesty does
not have the effect of obliterating his lack of good moral character.

408

It distinguished dual citizenship which is involuntary,
from dual allegiance that refers to a situation in which a person
simultaneously owes loyalty by some positive act to two or more
states. (Cordora • COMELEC, G.R. No. 176947, February 19, 2008)
2.
Republic Act No. 9225 which allows dual citizenship to a
natural-born Filipino Citizen who has lost Philippine Citizenship
by naturalization in a foreign country, is constitutional as a mode
of re-acquiring Filipino Citizenship. Whether they retain foreign
citizenship is for the foreign country to determine. (Calilung v.
Datumanong, G.R. No. 60869, May 11, 2007)
3.
A green card holder is disqualified from holding elective
office unless he waives his permanent resident status in the U.S.

/

4.
Mr. A is a Filipino Citizen who is a permanent resident
in a foreign country. Can he register as an absentee voter if he
executes an affidavit stating his declaration that he will resume
actual physical permanent residence in the Philippines within two
years?
Answer: Yes, the residency requirement is not applicable
to Filipinos abroad. When Mr. A made the said declaration in his
affidavit, he merely expressed his intention that he has not lost his
domicile in the Philippines. (Macalintal v. Commission on Elections,
G.R. No. 157013, July 10, 2003)
5.
A non-resident may, as an exception to the residency
requirement in the preceding section, be allowed to vote. Republic
Act No. 9225 does not provide that "duals" actually establish
residence and physically stay in the Philippines first before they can
exercise the right to vote. (Loida Nicolas-Lewis, et al. v. Comelec,
G.R. No. 162759, August 4, 2006)
6.
Those seeking elective public office in the Philippines
shall meet the qualification for holding such public office as required
by the Constitution and existing laws and, at the time of the filing of
the certificate of candidacy, make a personal and sworn renunciation
of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized
to administer an oath.

The Supreme Court ruled in Republic v. Li Yao, 214 SCRA
748, that a certificate of naturalization may be cancelled if it is

TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THE
INSOLVENCY LAW
1.
To have an equitable distribution of the properties of the
debtor among the creditors; and
2.

To give the debtor in good faith a fresh start in life.

PROCEEDINGS UNDER ANO BY VIRTUE OF
INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS
l.
Suspension of Payments Here, the debtor possesses
sufficient property to cover all his debts, but he foresees the
impossibility of meeting them when they respectively fall due. When
this happens, he may go to court and ask for suspension of payment
of his debts. In the meantime, the creditor should give him more
time within which to convert some of his properties to cash to be able
to pay his debts.
2.
Insolvency Proceedings The debtor has neither cash
nor property of sufficient value with which to pay all his debts.
TWO TYPES OF INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS
l.
Voluntary Insolvency
for insolvency

Solvency covers a situation where a debtor has more assets
than liabilities. Insolvency is a relative condition of man's assets
and liabilities, that even if all his assets are made immediately
available, they would not be sufficient to discharge him.

(Counsel for the Petitioner)

BASIC PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER AT A GLANCE

1.

Chattel Mortgage is merely a real right of security and does
not completely divert the mortgager of all ownership over the
mortgaged property;

2.

The mortgage of the personal property is given merely as
security for the performance of an obligation;

3.

Chattel Mortgage over a building belonging to another is void;

4.

A house may be treated as chattel by stipulation of the parties
in the document of mortgage. In this case, the principle is

FORECLOSURE OR MORTGAGE

It is the process by which the mortgagee-creditor is allowed to
have the mortgaged property foreclosed and sold in order that the
indebtedness may be paid out of the proceeds of said sale.

X

Mortgagee

KINDS OF FORECLOSURE
1.

JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE - This is a special civil action
referred to in Rule 68 of the Revised Rules of Court. As the
term itself implies, this requires court litigation. A proceeding
for judicial foreclosure is an action in rem. It is based on a
personal claim sought to be enforced against a specific property
of a person named party defendant. Its purpose is to have the
property seized and sold by court order to the end that the
proceeds thereof will be applied to the payment of plaintiffs
claim. Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, Rule 68, of the Revised
Rules of Court, provide for the rules and procedures to be
observed in case of judicial foreclosure.
In judicial foreclosures, the "foreclosure is not complete
until the Sheriffs Certificate of Sale is executed, acknowledged
and recorded. In the absence of a Certificate of Sale, no title
passes by foreclosure proceedings to the vendee." (Development
Bank of the Philippines v. Zaragosa, L-23493, August 23, 1978,
84 SCRA 673)

2.

EXTRAJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE - This is a process of
foreclosure provided in Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No.
4118. As the term itself implies, this process does not require
court litigation.
Foreclosure may be made judicially or extrajudicially.
Extrajudicial foreclosure is proper only when so provided in
the contract in accordance with Act No. 3135, as amended by
Act No. 4118.

DISTINCTION

I. Judicial foreclosure is initiated through a complaint
mentioned in Section 1, Rule 68, of the Revised Rules of Court.
Extrajudicial foreclosure is initiated by and through a formal written
petition, a sample of which is as follows:

stipulated interest and other charges and fees thereon.

2.

The terms and condition of the mortgage agreement (Annex
"A") were violated when the Mortgagor failed to pay and satisfy her
outstanding obligation to the mortgagee when the same fell due.
Since the default of the mortgagor, the mortgagee has not changed
the terms and conditions of the mortgagee agreement. To the best of
the mortgagee's belief, knowledge and information, the property of
the mortgagee is not subject to any prior mortgage or lien.

3.

At present, under the terms and condition of the mortgage
agreement and by what appears in the record and books of the
mortgagee, the mortgagor is indebted to the mortgagee, in the
aggregate amount of

penalties, as of

expenses, the payment of which amounts are all secured by the

Therefore, by virtue of the power of attorney in favor of the
mortgagee or her duly-authorized representative, as contained in
the mortgage agreement, we respectfully request your good office
to sell the mortgage property at public auction thru extrajudicial
foreclosure proceedings to the highest bidder in the manner and
form prescribed by Act No. 3135, as amended, on such date and time

In extrajudicial foreclosure, the mortgagor has the right to
redeem the property within one year from the registration of the
deed of sale. (Reyes • Noblejas, L-23691, November 25, 1967) 'The
date of sale mentioned in Section 6 of Act 3135 as amended should
be construed to mean the date of registration of the certificate of
sale in the registry of deeds. (Santos v. Register of Deeds of Manila,
L-26752, March 19, 1971; Reyes v. Tolentino, et al., L-29142,
November 29, 1971)
In judicial foreclosure, there is no such right of redemption,
except in the case of mortgages with banking institutions, but the
mortgagor has the "equity of redemption" which he can exercise
any time after service of the judgment of foreclosure and within the
period provided herein, and even thereafter, provided he does so
before the foreclosure sale is confirmed by the court. (Anderson v.

candidates have regularly attended classes and passed the subjects
under the same conditions as ordinary students and the ratings
obtained by them in the particular subject.
In June 8, 2004, the "FIVE STRIKE RULE" was laid down by
the Supreme Court in Bar Matter No. 1161.
Under the "Five Strike Rule," a bar candidate shall be
disqualified after failing thrice; provided that the candidate may
take a fourth or fifth examination if he successfully completes a oneyear refresher course for each examination.
The Five Strike Rule was first implemented in the 2005 bar
examinations, although those who have reached or exceeded five
takes as of 2004 should be allowed to take the bar one more time
upon completion of a one-year refresher course. Prior to Five Strike
Rule, there was no limit to the number of times a candidate could
take the bar.

On September 3, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its much
awaited resolution lifting the Five Strike Rule. The said resolution
reads as follows:
The court resolved, upon the recommendation of
the Committee on Continuing Legal Education and Bar
Matters, to LIFT the Five Strike Rule on bar repeaters,
provided that the candidates have enrolled in and passed
in regular fourth year review classes as well as attended
a pre-bar review course every time they take the Bar

PRACTICE OF LAW IS MORE OF A PRIVILEGE
THAN ARIGHT
The practice of law is not a matter of right. It is a privilege
accorded to only those who measure up to certain rigid standards of
mental and moral fitness. Anyone who is granted the said privilege
is expected to maintain the said rigid standards.

472

LEGAL FORMS

In three separate cases, the Supreme Court made the following
statements:
Tan v. Sabandal, B.M. No. 44
Bequia v. Sabandal, SBC 66, Feb. 24, 1992
Melencio-Herrera, J.
"The practice of law is not a matter of right. It is a
privilege bestowed upon individuals who are not learned
in the law but who are also known to possess good moral
character."
Legarda v. Court of Appeals
G.R. No. 94457, June 10, 1992
En Banc, Per Curiam
"Lawyers are indispensable part of the whole system
of administrative justice in this jurisdiction. At a time
when strong and disturbing criticisms are being hurled at
the legal profession, strict compliance with one's oath of
office and the Canons of Professional Ethics is imperative."
"Lawyers should be fair, honest, respectable, above
suspicion and beyond reproach in dealing with their
clients. The profession is not synonymous with an ordinary
business profession. It is a matter of public interest."
WHAT IS PRA CTICE OF LAW?

In Cayetano v. Monsod, G.R. No. 100113, September 31,
1991, the Supreme Court held that engaging in law practice is not
only confined to courtroom practice. It includes any activity which
requires application of law or knowledge of the law, whether said
activity takes place in or outside of the courtrooms. Hence, 10
years of work experience as lawyer-manager, lawyer-negotiator of
contracts, lawyer-economist or lawyer entrepreneur is considered as
within the meaning of the phrase "practice of law."
ALTHOUGH PRACTICE OF LAW IS MORE OF
A PRIVILEGE THAN A RIGHT, IT BECOMES
A RIGHT FROM THE TIME A PERSON IS
ADMITTED TO THE BAR
From a time a person is admitted to the bar, he cannot be
prevented from practicing law except when there are valid reasons
that will prevent him or her from practicing law.

PART III
MISCELLANEOUS 'TOPICS, PLEADINGS, AND FORMS

473

PRA CTICE OF LAW IS A PROFESSION AND NOT A BUSINESS

Law advocacy is not a capital that yields profits. The returns it
give birth to are simple rewards for job done or service rendered. It is
a calling that, unlike mercantile pursuits which enjoy a greater deal
of freedom from government interference, is impressed with public
interest, for which it is subject to State regulation. (Metropolitan
Bank and Trust Company v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 86100-03,
January 23, 1990, Second Dwision, Regalado, J.)
Membership in the legal profession is achieved only after a
long and laborious study. By years of patience, zeal, and ability,
the attorney acquires a fixed means of support for himself and his
family. This is not to say, however, that the emphasis is on the
pecuniary value of this profession but rather on the social prestige
and intellectual standing necessarily arising from and attached to
the same person of the fact that everyone is deemed an officer of the
court. (Conrad v. Navarro, Adm. Case No. 2033; Ortigas v. Navarro,
Adm. Case No. 2148, May 9, 1990, En Banc, Per Curiam)
On the one hand, the profession of an attorney is of great
importance to an individual and the prosperity of his life may
depend on its exercise. The right to exercise it ought not to be lightly
or capriciously taken from him. On the other hand, it is extremely
desirable that the respectability of the Bar should be maintained
and that its harmony with the Bench should be preserved. For these
objects, some controlling power, some moderation, and judgment,
must be exercised. (Conrad • Navarro, supra; Ortigas v. Navarro,
supra)
THE DUTIES OF A LAWY ER

The lawyer has the following duties:
I.
To maintain allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines
and to support the Constitution and obey the laws of the Philippines;
2.
To observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of
justice and judicial officers;
3.
To counsel or maintain such actions or proceedings only
as appear to him to be just, and such defense only as he believes to
be honestly debatable under the law;
4.
To employ, for the purpose of maintaining the causes
confided to him, such means only as are consistent with truth and

LEGAL FORMS

PARTlll
MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS, PLEADINGS, AND FORMS

honor, and never seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by
an artifice or false statement of fact or law;

of a superior court, or for corruptly or willfully appearing as such
attorney for a party to a case without authority to do so. The practice
of soliciting cases at law for the purpose of gain, either personally or
through paid agents or brokers, constitutes malpractice.

474

5.
To maintain inviolate the confidence, and at every peril
to himself, to preserve the secrets of his client, and to accept no
compensation in connection with his client's business except from
him or with his knowledge and approval;
6.
To abstain from all offensive personality and to advance
no fact prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or witness,
unless required by the justice of the cause with which he is charged;
7.
Not to encourage either the commencement or the
continuance of an action or proceeding, or delay any man's cause,
from any corrupt motive or interest;
8.
Never to reject, for any consideration personal to himself,
the cause of the defenseless or oppressed; and
9.
In the defense of a person accused of a crime, by all fair
and honorable means, regardless of his personal opinion as to the
guilt of the accused, to present every defense that the law permits to
the end that no person may be deprived of life or liberty, but by due
process of law.
LAWY ER'S COMPENSATION

An attorney shall be entitled to have and recover from his client
not more than a reasonable compensation for his services, with a
view of the importance of the subject matter of the controversy, the
extent of the services rendered, and the professional standing of the
attorney. No court shall be bound by the opinion of attorneys as
expert witnesses as to the proper compensation, but may disregard
such testimony and base its conclusion on its own professional
knowledge. A written contract for services shall control the amount
to be paid therefore unless found by the court to be unconscionable
or unreasonable.
DISCIPLINARY POWER OVER ATTORNEYS

A member of the bar may be removed or suspended from his
office as attorney by the Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice,
or other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral conduct,
or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude,

INTEGRATION OF THE BAR DEFINED
This is the official unification of all lawyers in the Philippines
under one official national organization which is known and called
as INTEGRATED BAR OF THE PHILIPPINES.
LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS
Section 5(5) of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution is the

The legal basis is founded on the principle that
THE
INHERENT POWER OF THE SUPREME COURT TO REGULATE
THE BAR INCLUDES THE AUTHORITY TO INTEGRATE THE

APPEARANCES ANO HANDLING OF CASES IN COURTS
As a rule, only those who are licensed to practice law can
appear and handle cases in court. However, this rule is subject to
the following exceptions and limitations:
EXCEPTIONS:
Under Rule 138 A, Revised Rules of Courts, a law student
who has successfully completed his third year in law school and
currently enrolled in a recognized law school's Clinical Legal
Education program approved by the Supreme Court may appear
in any civil, criminal or administrative case to represent indigent
clients accepted by the legal clinic,
LIMITATIONS:

SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF
CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY
(1) To compel a lawyer to be a member of the Integrated
Bar does not violate his constitutional freedom to associate (or the
corollary right not to associate).

(2) Integration does not make a lawyer a member of any
group of which he is not already a member. He became a member of
the Bar when he passed the Bar Examinations.
(3) For the court to prescribe dues to be paid by the members
does not mean that the Court levies a tax. "A membership fee in the
integrated bar is an exaction for regulation, while the purpose of a
tax is revenue. If the court has the inherent power to regulate the
Bar; it follows that as an incident to regulation, it may impose a
membership fee for that purpose. xx x"
(4) The Supreme Court, in order to further the State's
legitimate interest in elevating the quality of professional services,
may require that the cost of improving the profession in this fashion
be shared by the subjects and beneficiaries of the regularity program
the lawyers.
(5) And because it is a new regulation in exchange for new
benefits, it is not retroactive, it is not unequal, it is not unfair. (In re
Integration of the Bar of he Philippines, 22 SCRA 22-28-31, 1973; In
re Edilion, A.M. No. 1928, August 3, 1978)

1.
The appearance of said student in court is subject to
supervision and control of a member of IBP duly accredited by the
law school.

2.
Any pleading, motion, brief, memoranda and other papers
to be filed must be signed by the supervising attorney. (Secs. 1 and
2, Rule 138, RRC)
3.
When a law student appears before the court, he is subject
to supervision and control of a member of IBP. However, such rule
shall not apply if the law student appears as non-lawyer before the
inferior courts, provided he is an agent or friend of the party litigant
as prescribed by Section 34, Rule 138 of the RRC. (Cruz v. Mona,
552, SCRA 387, April 27, 2007)
4.
It is required that the supervising layer should be
physically present during the hearing.
CAN NON-LAWYERS APPEAR IN COURTS?
As a rule a non-lawyer who practices law will be guilty of
illegal practice of law. (Zeta v. Malinao; Administrative Case No.
P-22, December 20, 1978)
However, this rule is subject to the following exceptions and
limitations:
1.
Incases before the M'TC, a party may conduct his litigation
in person, with the aid of an agent or friend appointed by him. (Ge€.

contempt as an officer of the court who has misbehaved in his official
transaction.
Attorneys who are suspended or disbarred but continues
to engage in the practice of law are liable for contempt in
court, punishable by fine or imprisonment or both upon
the discretion of the court. (Betran v. Abad, A.M. No. 139,
March 28, 1983) He is also held liable although he acted as
an agent of a litigant or the circumstances provides that
he holds himself out as a lawyer in association, since he
cannot do indirectly. (In re David, 93 Phil. 461 [19541)

3.
If he appears personally, he is bound by the same rules
in conducting the trial of his case. He cannot after judgment, claim
that he was not properly represented by counsel. (Cruz v. Cabrera,
441 SCRA 211, October 25, 2004)
4.
In a criminal case before the MTC, and in locality where
a duly licensed member of the Bar is not available, the judge may
appoint a non-lawyer who is: (a) a resident of the province; and (b) of
good refute for probity and ability to aid the accused in his defense.

In addition to contempt, a lawyer may also be disciplined
suspended or disbarred for misconduct as an officer of
the court, if in his capacity he makes possible the illegal
practice of law by a layman. (People v. De Luna, 102 Phil.
968, January 31, 1958)

CAN NON-LAWYERS APPEAR IN THE NLRC
OR BEFORE THE LABOR ARBITER?
They may if they represent themselves as party to the case; if
they represent a labor organization which is party to the case. If they
represent a member or members of a legitimate labor organization
that is existing within the employers establishment who are parties
and the case; if they are duly accredited members of any legal and
duly recognized by the DOJ or the IBP; if the non-lawyer is the owner
or president of a corporation or establishment which is a party to the
case. (Sec. 6/6], 2011, NLRC Rules of Procedures)
WHO ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN
THE PRACTICE OF LAW?
(1) Those who do not possess the qualifications for admission
to the bar and have not complied with the requirements to practice
law are prohibited to practice law; (2) A lawyer who is disbarred
unless readmitted, is prohibited to practice law; (3) Those who are
suspended are prohibited to practice law during the period of their
suspension.

WHAT ARE THE SANCTIONS FOR PRACTICE

They are subject to any of the following sanctions:
l.

Lawyers without authority

Finally, he may find himself administratively liable for being
a government attorney at the same time engages on the private
practice of law without the written permit from his immediate
superior. (Misamin v. San Juan, 72 SCRA, August 31, 1976)
2.

Persons not Lawyers

Shyster
a non-lawyer pretending to be a lawyer. (Funa
Legal and Judicial Ethics: With Bar Examination Questions, 2009,
p. 120)
A person may be punished for indirect contempt for assuming
to be an attorney of a court, and acting as such without authority.
(Sec. 3/e}, Rule 71, RRC)
When a person assumes to be an attorney, he is liable for
contempt of court. (PAFLU u. Binalbagan Isabela Sugar
Co., 42 SCRA 302, November 29, 1971)
Another case provides that if a person's unauthorized practice
of law resulted to damage to another party, the former may likewise
be liable for cstafa. This situation is regardless of the success in
managing the litigation by the said person. (U.S. v. Durban, 36 Phil.
